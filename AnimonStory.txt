Welcome to

ANIMON STORY!
These are stories about kids and monsters becoming friends
and evolving to overcome adversity. These are
stories about disparate yet kindred spirits coming
together and forming unbreakable bonds.

Building and sustaining those bonds is not always an easy
task, but those who do will learn a lot about themselves and
their friends — and most of all they’ll learn how truly
powerful those bonds of friendship can be.

Your very own Animon Story is about to begin...

004

What is Animon Story?
Animon Story is a tabletop roleplaying game inspired by classic
‘Kids & Monsters’ (or ‘Mons’) media, especially 90s anime and video
games such as Digimon and Pokémon. You might also be familiar with
series like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yo-Kai Watch, Bakugan, Beyblade, and Monster
Rancher, all of which involve kids teaming up with fantastical
monsters in one way or another. Often, this involves using monsters
to battle opponents.
In Animon Story, you’ll take on the role of Kids who team up with
their very own monster buddies, called Animon. Together you’ll go
on adventures, solve problems, grow as friends, and maybe even save
the world. Being a tabletop roleplaying game, you’ll do this through
the medium of a conversation with the other players, sometimes
rolling dice, and often making notes about the shared story you are
all telling as a group.
The Kids in these stories commonly fit into archetypal character
roles — similar sorts of characters you often find in this genre. The
monsters can vary a lot within the genre, and it’s encouraged for each
group to decide together exactly how the monsters fit into their
stories, but there are three rules to which Animon always abide:
1. Animon partners are sentient, intelligent monsters that can
speak human languages.
2. When an Animon builds a strong bond of friendship with a
Kid partner, they will grow in strength and eventually gain the
ability to evolve into powerful (but temporary) new forms.
3. Animon are from another world (or worlds) to our own
— this could be cyberspace, a fairy ‘Otherworld,’ the worlds
within human dreams, or anything else you decide!

005

What You’ll Need
To play Animon Story, first you’ll need a group of people who want to
join you! Once you have that, you’re ready to start learning the game
and creating characters. You’ll also need a few other things to play:

•

•

•

Dice: This game uses standard 6-sided dice. If you don’t have
many, you can buy some from a game store or get them
online. Otherwise, you can roll dice digitally using an online
dice rolling app on a laptop or phone. When using physical dice,
it’s recommended to have at least 10 between the whole group.
Pens/Pencils and Notepaper: You’ll be creating a story together
as you play, so you should make notes about what’s happening!
You’ll also need to keep track of certain things on the character
sheet, so having a pencil and an eraser is a good idea.
Character Sheets: These are special sheets that you’ll fill with
information about the characters you create. You can copy the
sheet from the back of this book or download them. Each player
needs one character sheet, which consists of two pages.
It’s recommended that you download and print character sheets
at A4 size, to ensure you have enough space for writing.
Character sheets and other supplementary materials can
be downloaded from www.animonstory.com.

The Core

Mechanic
This game is played out through conversation between everyone in
the group. One person takes on the role of the Gamemaster (GM),
while the others are Players. The Gamemaster acts as the main
narrator, while each Player makes up their own characters: a Kid and
their Animon companion.
Each Player has a character sheet containing important information
about both their Kid character and their Animon companion. This
information is used in the game to help determine the path of the
story, often based on dice rolls which indicate the successes and
failures of the Player Characters (PCs).

Tests
When a PC attempts a task that has a significant chance of failure,
they are attempting a ‘Test’. The Player rolls dice to determine whether
their character has passed or failed the Test. This game uses multiple
6-sided dice (D6s) in all rolls. To resolve a Test:
1. The player assembles a pool of D6s based on their PC’s
characteristics. The characteristics used are determined by
the Player and GM agreeing on which ones are most useful for
the task at hand (the different characteristics are all explained
later). The Player may also decide to spend ‘Bond Points’ to
add more dice to the pool.
a. For a Kid character this is usually: Trait + Talent(s).
b. For an Animon character this is usually: Stat + Quality
(+ Signature Attack if applicable).

007

2. The GM announces the Difficulty Rating of the task. This
is a number typically ranging from 1 to 5. The standard
Difficulty Rating is 2.
3. The Player rolls their pool of D6s and counts how many
‘Successes’ they have rolled. Under normal circumstances,
each dice showing a result of 4+ counts as a success. If the
number of successes rolled is equal or greater than the
Difficulty Rating of the task, the character has passed the
Test. If not, they have failed. They may then choose to ‘Push’
the roll and have another chance at the cost of gaining ‘Bond
Strain’ (see the Pushing Rolls section).
For example, a Kid character attempting to climb a wall would use
one of their Traits and any relevant Talents to assemble a dice pool.
This will be explained later - for now let’s assume the dice pool ends up
with 4 dice in it. The GM announces that climbing the wall will be
Difficulty 2. The Player rolls their pool and gets the following results:
5, 4, 2, and 1, scoring 2 Successes (since each result of 4+ is a success).
The Kid is able to climb the wall!

Setback and Boost
In some situations, a character attempting a Test may be helped or
hindered by something. In these cases the player rolls with either a
Setback or a Boost.

•

When rolling with a Setback, only dice results of 5+ count
as successes.

•

When rolling with a Boost, dice results of 3+ count as successes.

For example, a character attempting to interpret strange symbols would
roll with a Boost if they happened to have a handy book on symbology.
On the other hand, the character would roll with a Setback if they were
attempting to interpret the symbols in a dark room.
In some rare cases, characters may roll with Double Setback or
Double Boost. With Double Setback, only dice results of 6 count as
successes while, in the case of Double Boost, results of 2+ count!

KIDS

009

Creating kid

characters
The main characters of any Animon Story are the Kids and their
partner Animon, but while the GM sometimes takes on the role of a
character’s Animon, the actions and moods of a Kid are always firmly
in the control of the Player. The Kid is the character that a Player truly
inhabits in the story.
It’s best for all Players to create their characters at the same time, in a
group. This way you can ensure there’s not too much overlap and
discuss the relationships between the characters as they are created.
All Players should fill out their Character Sheets as they go through
the Character creation process.
These steps describe how to create a Kid character and are fully
detailed in the following sections:
1. Choose Kid Type (Bookworm, Computer Wizard, Delinquent,
Free Spirit, Gamer, Gentle Heart, Grown-Up, Jock, Little Kid, Loner,
Rising Star, Wild Child, Young Aristocrat).
a. Record Type Feature.
b. Choose an Iconic Item.
c. Choose a Talent.
d. Choose a Flaw.
e. Choose a Desire.
f. Choose some Stuff.
g. Determine Relationships.
2. Choose Traits.
3. Set Stamina.
4. Set Bond Level, Bond Points, and Bond Strain.
5. Choose a Virtue.
6. Choose a Name.

010

1. Choose Kid Type
Each Kid has a Type, which serves as a broad description of the
character. In your group, each PC should be of a different Kid Type.
The Kid Type is linked with a number of character features that can be
chosen from a list or made up by the GM and Players.

Type Feature

This is a special feature unique to each Kid Type. It represents
something that each Type is specialised in. In all cases, the Type
Feature presents situations in which characters of that Type gain
Boost on their rolls. This is usually applied to rolls using Kid’s Traits
but if the GM decides it’s relevant, the same bonus can be applied to
rolls using Animon Stats.

Special Item

A Kid’s Special Item is something they’ll rarely, if ever, be seen
without. It might be a handy tool, a prize possession, or something
of personal significance. When a PC’s item plays a significant role in
the story, they gain the effects of spending a Bond Point for free (see
the Bond Points section). When choosing a Special Item, also decide
how the Kid got it — was it a birthday present from a loved one, a
purchase they saved up for themselves, or something else? A Special
Item cannot be permanently lost, unless the Player and GM agree
there is a very good reason for it (after which the Player can choose a
new Special Item).

Talent

Talents are specific things that characters are good at. Talents can
be related to academic knowledge (Biology, Chemistry, Geography,
etc.), physical strengths (Long Jump, Sprinting, Climbing, etc.),
social skills (Small Talk, Persuasion, Deception, etc.), creative skills
(Baking, Dancing, Fashion, etc.) or anything in between; they can
also be more descriptive terms such as a belief or disposition (The
Grown-up One, Graceful, Quiet Confidence, Insatiable Curiosity, etc.).
Talents have a Rank, which is the number of dice they add to pools
when that Talent is useful. All Talents start at Rank 1, but characters
can increase their Talent Ranks (up to a maximum of Rank 3) and
even gain new Talents throughout the game.

011

Flaw

A Flaw is anything that has a chance to create a disadvantage for
a character. They are as diverse as Talents and can be anything from
allergies to phobias to troublesome personality quirks. Whenever a
Flaw would make it more difficult for a Kid to attempt a Test, they
gain Setback on the roll. Flaws might also encourage particular
actions or events in the story.

Desire

A Kid’s Desire is something that they want more than almost
anything else in the world. It might also be something they don’t have
(or believe they don’t have) at the start of the story. Sometimes Kids
will act in selfish or destructive ways to pursue their Desire, but they
also learn from these mistakes. When a Kid chases their Desire in a
way that causes serious problems for their Animon partner or the rest
of the group, they immediately gain 1 Bond Strain and 1XP.

Stuff

Stuff is much less important than a Kid’s Special Item, but it can still
come in handy sometimes. This is basically a collection of whatever
the Kid has in their pockets at any particular moment. Stuff can be
lost and replaced as regularly as is appropriate in the story. At some
point, the Kids will each get an Ani-Tool, a special item related to
their bond with an Animon. This can also be recorded in the Stuff
section when obtained.

Determine Relationships

Relationships give an idea of how each Kid in the group knows the
others. Perhaps they all go to the same school, participate in the same
club, or live in the same neighbourhood. Maybe they don’t know each
other particularly well before the story starts, but at the very least they
aren’t total strangers. Whatever brings the whole group together, you
should think about the different relationships between each Kid and
make notes. Players can discuss this among themselves and invent
their own relationships, or they can check the relationships given
with each type. Of course, all relationships evolve over time, so these
should only be considered a starting point.

THE gentle heart
People rarely just get along — and that’s where you come in.

to appreciate your soothing presence even without realising it.
You always look for the best in others, but it can be so much
harder to see it in yourself.

THE grown-up
College, interviews, rent…growing up isn’t exactly like you
thought it’d be. There’s freedom in it, but also frightening new
responsibility. It feels as though you’re pretending to have it
all figured out, like you’re not really ‘grown-up’ at all, but the
younger ones look up to you now. For their sake and yours,
you’ll have to do your best.

Seize every opportunity! Push your limits! Never back down!

that’s not always as easy as scoring the winning goal.

THE YOUNG ARISTOCRAT

you were raised to. According to your family, you’re “a jewel of

2. Choose Traits
Kid characters have three Traits that are each assigned a numerical
score. Traits partly represent the physical, mental, and social abilities
of a Kid, while also representing the approach to problem-solving
favoured by each Kid. When using a Trait to attempt a Test, the Player
adds a number of dice to the pool equal to the score of that Trait.
The three Traits are:

•

Logic

This Trait is best applied to devising solutions based on
careful planning, strategy, and knowledge. Kids with high
Logic scores are typically smart and well-prepared.
Logic would be used for Tests related to using unfamiliar
technology, identifying important information, solving puzzles or
riddles, putting together clues, and other things based on reasoning
and understanding.

•

Reflex

This Trait is best applied to using physical aptitude, staying
sharp, and responding quickly to the unexpected. Kids with
high Reflex scores are typically keen and physically fit.
Reflex would be used for Tests related to most physical challenges
like running, jumping, sneaking, and climbing, as well as sensing
danger, spotting something hidden, and other things based on
instincts and coordination.

•

Spirit

This Trait is best applied to bolstering determination and
using strength of character to persuade or influence
others. Kids with high Spirit scores are typically confident
and resolute.
Spirit would be used for Tests related to facing fears, forging ahead
through dire circumstances, making friends, being persuasive,
leading others, and other things based on moxie and willpower.

040

When creating your Kid character, distribute scores of 4, 3, and 2
between the three Traits as you see fit. This gives each Kid a stronger
Trait, an average Trait, and a weaker Trait. Note that these remain the
same throughout the game and cannot be directly improved.

3. Set Stamina
Stamina is a pool of points that represents how tired, hungry, or
possibly injured a Kid is. If a Kid’s Stamina is reduced to 0 they
become completely exhausted and usually fall unconscious. A Kid’s
Stamina score is equal to 9 + Bond Level, which means all starting
Kid characters have 10 Stamina.

4. Choose a Virtue
All Kids start with a Virtue, a characteristic with which they are most
strongly associated. Even if they don’t realise it to begin with, this
Virtue represents their role within the group and is something that
others look up to them for. The Virtue is always something that can be
put to the test by challenges and obstacles that the Kids face in the
story. The link between a Kid and their Virtue might not be very
obvious from the get-go, especially to themselves, but it will always
shine through in the end. Having their Virtue tested and coming out
stronger is one way for Kid characters to earn XP.
Players may select a Virtue from the following list, or make up their
own with the GM. No two Kids should have the same Virtue:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Courage
Friendship
Forgiveness
Hope
Kindness
Understanding
Love
Loyalty
Reliability
Sincerity
Wisdom

041

5. Choose a Name
Finish off your Kid character with a suitable name! Hopefully by this
stage you will have a clear enough idea of your Kid character to give
them a name that fits well.

6. Set Bond Level, Bond Points, and 		
Bond Strain
Bond Level represents the growing bond of trust and friendship
between a Kid and their partner Animon. This Level is shared
between Kid and Animon partners. All characters start with a Bond
Level of 1. Bond Level is increased by gaining and spending XP. All
characters start with 0XP.
Bond Points can be spent to improve the odds of success, take action
in critical situations, and do a number of other useful things. All
partners start with a pool of 6 Bond Points.
Bond Strain represents the stresses and difficulties of the relationship
between a Kid and their Animon partner. Sometimes even the closest
of friendships are tested. Bond Strain starts at 0 and is increased at
certain points in the story. If a PCs Bond Strain is ever higher than
their maximum number of Bond Points, the partners are at risk of a
‘Bond Break Episode,’ in which their bond will be put to an ultimate
test.

042

ANIMON

Creating Animon

characters
Animon are amazing beings from another world that is tied to ours.
They typically take the form of small creatures, though they are
intelligent and most can speak and understand the languages of their
partner. When they grow, especially through a bond with a Kid, they
can Evolve into larger and more powerful forms. The five stages of
Animon Evolution from lowest to highest are:

FLEDGLING > BASIC > SUPER > ULTRA > GIGA
The characteristics of an Animon can potentially undergo drastic
changes through Evolution. When creating an Animon character, you
determine the characteristics of the BASIC Stage first, as this is the
Stage an Animon spends most time in. More details are given in the
‘Evolution’ section.
Note on playing two characters
Each Kid character has an Animon partner, so in some ways each
Player is responsible for two characters. The GM may sometimes play
the role of the Animon companion, especially during conversations
between partners. Animon will generally do anything they are asked
by their Kid partners, but they still have their own will and personality.
Some Players may find it easier to distinguish by referring to their Kid
character in the first person, and their Animon character in the third
person, for example:
“I cross the room and open the door on the other side, while my partner
Animon watches the corridor behind for approaching enemies.”

1. Choose Classification
All Animon can be broadly placed within one of twelve different
categories. This is called their Classification (abbreviated to Class
on the character sheet). This is a general descriptive term that helps
to give Players an understanding of what each Animon looks like and
how they might act. An Animon character’s Classification grants
Boost to any rolls made when interacting with non-hostile Animon of
the same Classification, and it also grants Boost to any rolls made to
explore or navigate through their favoured environment.
Choose which Classification your Animon will have:

046

•

Dragon: These Animon often have draconic and/or
dinosaur-like features like scales, horns, wings, and claws. They
typically favour rocky, mountainous environments, but this can
vary based on their Element.

•

Beast: These Animon often resemble mammalian animals.
They might have fur, paws, or prominent ears. They typically
favour field and grassland environments.

•

Avian: These Animon most strongly resemble birds, often
possessing feathers, wings, beaks, or talons. They typically
favour skyward environments.

•

Insect: These Animon possess insectoid features, resembling
insects and arachnids. They might have many legs, transparent
wings, or chitinous exoskeletons. They typically favour dense
forest and jungle environments.

•

Plant: These Animon look like plants and often have roots,
vines, or flowers. They favour environments with abundant
and diverse vegetation like woodlands and gardens.

•

Aquatic: These Animon resemble all sorts of sea creatures.
They might have fins, fish scales, or thick fur, and are typically
excellent swimmers. They favour lakes, rivers, and ocean
environments.

•

Celestial: These Animon are often radiant, ethereal beings
with angelic qualities. They are very diverse but often wield
ancient relics or possess shining wings. They tend to favour
consecrated environments such as shrines and temples.

•

Infernal: These Animon are in some way fiendish or demonic.
They might have pointed horns or shadow wings, and favour
desolate environments like wastelands or volcanoes.

•

Machine: These Animon are defined by their machine parts.
They may have metal limbs or they might be fully mechanical.
They favour urban and industrial environments.

•

Fairy: These Animon often resemble fey creatures like pixies,
sylphs, or gnomes. They might have gossamer wings or strange
illusory powers. They favour supernatural environments such as
enchanted woods.

•

Nightmare: These Animon often resemble ghosts, ghouls,
goblins, or other spooky supernatural beings. They might have
spectral bodies, scary fangs, or glowing eyes. They favour
ominous environments like abandoned houses and ruins.

•

Unknown: Any Animon that doesn’t fit into one of the other
Classifications is ‘Unknown.’ They might be amorphous, or have
otherwise unusual features. Their favoured environments vary a
lot between individuals (Players and GMs should discuss this).

047

2. Choose Element
All Animon have an attunement to one of ten different Elements,
which are sources of power drawn from different aspects of the world.
This is sometimes called their Innate Element. Choose which Innate
Element your Animon will have:

•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

Fire
Water
Nature
Electric
Earth

Wind
Light
Dark
Mirage
Neutral

In battle, depending on the match-up between the Element of an
attack and the Element of the defending Animon, the attack may be
made with Setback or Boost.

Fire

Water

Nature

Electric

048

Earth

Wind

Light

Mirage

Dark

3. Choose Nature
Animon are all very different and have unique personalities. This is
represented by an Animon’s Nature, which has both a positive and a
negative side. Choose your Animon’s Nature from the following list or
make up your own with the GM:

•

Balanced
(Fair but Indecisive)

•

Friendly
(Kind but Gullible)

•

Cautious
(Careful but Fearful)

•

Lonely
(Calm but Disconnected)

•

Headstrong
(Brave but Stubborn)

•

•

Studious
(Knowledgeable but
Awkward)

Eager
(Confident but
Overambitious)

•

Joyful
(Merry but Foolish)

•

Obedient
(Attentive but Dependant)

The Nature of an Animon character grants them no particular
mechanical bonus. Instead, it is a useful tool for determining how that
character will speak and act in the story. It’s recommended that a Kid
and their Animon have different, perhaps even opposing natures, so
that their relationship is dynamic and interesting.

049

4. Determine Stats
Animon characters have four Stats that are equivalent to the Kid
characters’ Traits in some ways: they are used to create dice pools when
the Animon is attempting a Test or attacking. They also help determine
the HP, Dodge, Damage, and Initiative scores of the Animon. The
four Stats are:

•

Power

•

Heart

•

Brains

•

Agility

This Stat is a measure of the strength and raw energy flowing
through an Animon, as well as the ability of that Animon to
transform that energy into powerful attacks. This Stat
determines the Damage score.
This Stat determines the vitality and endurance of an Animon,
as well as their moxie and strength of spirit. This Stat determines
the HP score.
This Stat determines how quick witted, perceptive, and
knowledgeable an Animon is. This Stat determines the
Initiative score and the number of times the Animon can use
their Signature Attacks in battle.
This Stat determines how swift and dexterous an Animon is,
as well as how quick their reflexes are. This Stat determines the
Dodge score.

When creating your Animon character, start by assigning the Stats
for the BASIC Stage: all Stats start at a base of 1, after which you may
then distribute 8 points between them as you see fit. You cannot raise
a Stat higher than 4 at the BASIC Stage.
Next, determine Stats for the FLEDGLING Stage: all Stats start at
a base of 1, after which you may then distribute 4 points between
them as you see fit. You cannot raise a Stat higher than 3 at the
FLEDGLING Stage. The distribution of scores doesn’t necessarily
have to match the BASIC Stage.

050

5. Set HP, Damage, Dodge,
and Initiative
Animon Stats are used to determine these four important derived
statistics: HP, Dodge, Damage, and Initiative. While Stats themselves
are only increased through Evolution, derived statistics can be
improved as characters reach higher Bond Levels.
HP is a pool of ‘hit points’ that represent how much damage an
Animon can take before being knocked out. When an Animon
character reaches 0HP they are knocked out, and in some cases will
be forced to Devolve back into a lower Stage.
• HP for a BASIC Stage Animon is equal to 5 + (3 x Heart).
• HP for a FLEDGLING Stage Animon is equal to 3 x Heart.
Damage represents the destructive power of an Animon’s attacks.
Whenever an Animon makes a successful attack their Damage score
is deducted from the opponent’s HP.
• Damage for a BASIC Stage Animon is equal to 2 x Power.
• Damage for a FLEDGLING Stage Animon is equal to Power.
Dodge represents how well an Animon can avoid or parry incoming
attacks. When an Animon must make a Dodge roll to avoid being hit
they roll a number of dice equal to their Dodge score.
• Dodge is equal to Agility.
Initiative represents how quickly an Animon is able to react to
danger. Whenever a Combat Encounter starts, all characters involved
must roll using Initiative to determine who acts first.
• Initiative is equal to Brains.
Make sure to fill in Dodge and Initiative for both the BASIC Stage and
the FLEDGLING Stage.

051

6. Create Signature Attack
Every single Animon of BASIC Stage or higher has a Signature Attack
that is unique to them. This takes the form of a special move with its
own Name, Element, and Effect. Signature Attacks also have a Rank,
which is the number of dice added to a pool when that Signature Attack
is being used. New animon Signature Attacks start at Rank 1.

Name

All Signature Attacks have names, and quite often an Animon will call
out the name of their ability when using it. Pick something fitting and
descriptive, like Lightning Breath, Spore Surprise, Aero Strike, Solar
Beam, or Lunar Blaster.

Uses

Unleashing powerful Signature Attacks isn’t easy. Each Animon can
only use their Signature Attack a certain number of times in a single
Combat Encounter. The number of Uses is equal to the Animon’s
Brains score. Animon who have run out of Uses may spend a Bond
Point to get an extra use of their Signature Attack. Animon get all
their Uses back when they catch their breath after the Combat
Encounter is over.

Element

Just like Animon themselves, Signature Attacks have an affinity to a
particular Element, sometimes called the Attack Element to help
distinguish between this and the Innate Element of the Animon.
Signature Attacks often have the same Element as the Animon they
belong to, but you may choose a different Element for your Signature
Attack if you want. The exception is Neutral Element Animon, who
must always have a Neutral Signature Attack. As a reminder, the
Elements are:
• Fire, Water, Nature, Electric, Earth, Wind, Light, Dark, Mirage,
Neutral.

Effect

The Effect of a Signature Attack is something that modifies what the
ability does, particularly when used in combat. When you create your
Animon’s Signature Attack, pick one of the following Effects:

052

•

Block-Break: When this attack successfully hits, you can
choose to deal half damage and make the target Vulnerable
instead of dealing damage as normal. You can’t make the same
target Vulnerable more than once in a Combat Encounter.
› Vulnerable enemies have Setback on Dodge rolls.

•

Efficient: the first time you use this Signature Attack in each
Combat Encounter, it doesn’t count towards the total Uses.

•

Energy Drain: when you deal damage with this attack, you
also regain HP equal to the Level of the target.

•

Explosive: when you successfully attack, you can choose to
make an explosive hit. If so, you deal half damage to the main
target. You also deal damage equal to your Level to all enemies
standing next to the target.

•

Heavy Strike: When it successfully hits, this Signature Attack
does extra damage equal to 1 + Rank.

•

Misdirect: When this attack successfully hits, you Disorient the
target until your next turn, as well as dealing damage as normal.
You cannot Disorient the same target more than once in a
Combat Encounter.
› Disoriented enemies have Setback on Attack rolls.

•

Multi-Element: choose an Element other than one this
Signature Attack already has. Whenever you use this attack, you
can choose which of those Elements it becomes for that attack.
This Effect can be taken multiple times to gain more Elements.

053

054

•

Multi-Hit: You can choose to target two or more enemies with
this attack by spending additional Signature Attack Uses. Make a
single Attack roll against the highest Dodge among the targeted
enemies. If successful, you deal damage equal to your Damage
score to a number of enemies equal to the number of Signature
Attack Uses spent. Only one target of a Multi-Hit attack may be
affected by another Signature Attack Effect.

•

Poison Strike: When this attack successfully hits, you can
choose to deal no damage and instead Poison the target. You can
only do this to one target in each Combat Encounter.
› Poisoned enemies take damage equal to your Power at the
end of their turn until the Combat Encounter ends.

•

Overcharge: Before using this attack you may spend as many
Signature Attack Uses as you want, as long as you have them
available. If the attack is successful deal damage as per usual,
but multiply your Damage score by the number of Uses spent.
If this leaves you with 0 Signature Attack Uses, you also
become Incapacitated until the end of your next turn.

•

Power Transfer: Instead of attacking with this ability, you can
use an Action to give the Boosted condition to a number of
nearby characters equal to your max. Signature Attack Uses.
› Boosted characters gain Boost on all their rolls for 1 turn.

•

Quick Strike: If the target of this attack has not yet acted in
the Combat Encounter, the Attack roll gains Boost.

•

Sap: When this attack successfully hits, you can choose to
deal half damage and Weaken the target until your next turn,
instead of dealing damage as normal. You cannot Weaken the
same target more than once in a Combat Encounter.
› Weakened enemies deal half damage.

•

Stunning Strike: When this attack successfully hits, you can
choose to deal no damage and Stun the target instead of
dealing damage as normal. You cannot Stun the same target
more than once in a Combat Encounter.
› Stunned enemies miss their next turn.

•

Sure Strike: When it misses, this Signature Attack still does
damage equal to half your Damage score.

7. Choose a Quality
Qualities describe the features of an Animon’s physiology, personality,
or abilities that help it in one way or another. In the story, whenever a
Quality would help your Animon do something, you add a number of
dice equal to the Rank of that Quality to your dice pool for any Tests
you have to attempt. Sometimes just having a Quality is enough to
change the outcome of a situation even without rolling.
Sometimes Qualities might help an Animon when attacking or
defending. For example, a Sharp Claws Quality could add dice to an
Attack roll if the Animon is fighting in close combat, while a Hard
Shell Quality could add dice to a Dodge roll if the Animon is
hunkered down and bracing themself.
When creating your Animon character, give them a single Rank 1
Quality at the BASIC Stage. You should make up your own Qualities
along with your GM. Here is a short list of examples:

055

My Animon should have multiple Qualities!
Sometimes Players might have difficulty picking just one Quality
to give their Animon character. For example, if a Player is making
a bird-like Animon, shouldn’t they have Sharp Claws AND Flight?
At the start of the game, Animon are not at full power. As they
earn XP, they can gain new Qualities and improve the ones they
already have. When creating a character, Players should think
about what the most important Quality of their Animon is.
If the bird-like Animon starts with Sharp Claws instead of Flight, it
doesn’t mean it doesn’t have wings. It doesn’t even mean they can’t
fly; it simply means flying isn’t currently one of their best skills.
Perhaps they haven’t learnt to fly properly yet, or perhaps their
wings haven’t fully developed! Later on, when the characters earn
more XP, the Animon can gain a new Quality, which represents
them training or developing a skill (for example, practicing to
improve their flying skills).

8. Choose a Name
Quite often, Animon are referred to by the name of their species but,
depending on what your group prefers, Animon could have personal
names or nicknames like humans. Sometimes Animon names follow a
pattern, like always having ‘mon’ at the end. As long as it fits within the
naming rules your group has decided on, pick any name you like!

9. Finish FLEDGLING Stage
Finally, finish off the FLEDGLING Stage of your Animon with a
Classification, Element, and Name. These don’t have to be the same as
the BASIC Stage — this depends on how much you think your Animon
should change between the two Stages! It is assumed that the Nature of
the Animon stays the same.

056

EVOLUTION

057

ANIMON

EVOLUTION
Evolution is an incredible process by which Animon transform,
change their bodies, gain new abilities, and become more powerful. The
exact reasons behind Animon Evolution are mysterious, but Animon
with Kid partners always seem to Evolve when the need is greatest.
There are five Stages to Animon Evolution, described here from
weakest to strongest:

Fledgling

Newborn Animon that hatch from
eggs are almost always FLEDGLING
Stage. These are typically small and
haven’t yet developed the unique
features that they will have in later
Stages, but they have enough energy
to put up a fight. Animon Devolve
to their FLEDGLING Stage if they
get particularly tired or hungry.

Basic

BASIC Stage Animon are the
most commonly encountered.
Animon partnered with Kids
spend most of their time in the
BASIC Stage, as it requires little
energy to maintain, but still has
significant power. At this Stage,
Animon gain more distinctive
features and a Signature Attack.

058

Super

SUPER Animon are significantly
more powerful than BASIC
Animon, but also expend a lot
more energy. Animon
partnered with Kids gain the
energy to Evolve to SUPER Stage
and beyond through the strength
of their bond. ‘Wild’ Animon
only reach SUPER Stage after
gathering considerable energy.

Ultra

ULTRA Stage Animon are more
powerful than most others.
They are usually equipped with
an array of powerful attacks
and abilities. It takes a massive
amount of energy to reach the
ULTRA Stage. This is achievable
through certain special means,
like naturally occurring places
of power or other supernatural
sources of energy.

Giga

Only the most powerful
Animon in the world reach
GIGA Stage, either through a
truly unbreakable bond with a
partner Kid or via seeking out
tremendous amounts of energy.
Some nefarious and villainous
Animon might reach the GIGA
Stage by absorbing energy from
other, weaker Animon.

059

Evolving Animon
At the beginning of an Animon Story, Kids often meet their partner
Animon in their FLEDGLING Stage. Early on in the story, perhaps
in the first session of play, the Animon of the group will Evolve to
their BASIC Stage.
To unlock SUPER Stage, an Animon must have a Bond Level of 3.
ULTRA Stage is unlocked at Bond Level 6, and finally GIGA Stage is
unlocked at Bond Level 9. The GM may decide there are other
requirements, such as collecting specific items or Ani-Tool upgrades.
If all requirements are met, an Animon will Evolve to their next Stage
“When the Need is Great.” It is up to the Player and the GM to
decide exactly when that is, but typically it will involve the Animon’s
Kid partner being in peril or the group relying on them to do
something critical.

The Cost of Evolution

When an Animon reaches a new Stage for the first time, their HP is
immediately restored to maximum. From then on, every time an
Animon Evolves to their current highest Stage, their HP is not reset,
and it costs 1 Bond Point; evolving to any Stage but the current
highest costs no points. Evolving is immediate and does not take an
action in combat.
Maintaining any Stage above BASIC takes a lot of energy. An Animon
can only remain in their highest available Stage for a single Combat
Encounter or Scene before Devolving again.
If an Animon has already Evolved to their current highest available
Stage, they will have trouble Evolving again without resting first. If an
Animon attempts to Evolve to any Stage without having Rested since a
previous Evolution to their highest available Stage, they must first gain
1 Bond Strain. This represents the extra effort required to Evolve when
an animon is already tired.

060

Devolution
Animon can willingly return to a lower Stage at any time. They may
be forced to Devolve if reduced to 0HP, or if they otherwise become
too hungry or tired to maintain a higher Stage. These things can occur
during a story if the GM decides there is a reason.
After an Animon has reached a new Evolution Stage for the first time,
they must Devolve back to the FLEDGLING Stage and rest before
they can return to the BASIC Stage. From then on, every time the
Animon Devolves from their highest available Stage, they must roll a
Heart Test with Difficulty Rating 2. If they pass, they Devolve back
to the BASIC Stage, and if they fail they Devolve to the FLEDGLING
Stage instead.
Whenever an Animon of SUPER Stage or higher is reduced to 0HP,
they must immediately Devolve and roll a Heart Test with Difficulty
Rating 3. If they pass, they Devolve to BASIC Stage; if they fail they
Devolve to FLEDGLING Stage. A BASIC Stage Animon reduced to
0HP must make the test to see if they remain at BASIC Stage or
Devolve to FLEDGLING Stage.

061

Damage and Evolution
Sometimes an Animon will Evolve or Devolve after having taken
damage. When this happens, the amount of damage they’ve taken is
subtracted from the new Stage’s maximum HP (the exception being if
this is the Animon’s first time reaching that Stage, as described earlier).
For example, a BASIC Stage Animon with 8/12 HP remaining Evolves
to SUPER Stage. In SUPER Stage they have a maximum HP of 24. Since
they have already taken 4 damage at BASIC Stage, when Evolving they
end up with 20/24 HP.
When an Animon that has taken damage Devolves, the same amount
of damage is subtracted from the lower Stage’s HP, down to a
minimum value of 1.
For example, a SUPER Stage Animon with 10/24HP remaining
Devolves to BASIC Stage. In BASIC Stage they have a maximum HP
of 12. Since they have already taken 14 damage at SUPER Stage, when
Devolving they end up with 1/12HP.

062

Creating Evolved Animon
Just like when creating characters for the first time, there are a number of
characteristics about an Animon’s Evolved Stages that must be decided
and written out onto the character sheet. It’s recommended that Players
prepare any new Stages they have unlocked when Levelling Up. That way
the new Evolution can be dramatically revealed when the time is right.
The process for creating Evolved Animon is similar to character
creation. These steps describe how it’s done:

1. Choose Classification and Element

In many cases, Evolved Animon will have the same Classification
and Element as their earlier Stages, but this does not have to be the
case. If you want your Animon to change more dramatically, feel free
to choose a new Classification and Element from the same lists that
are used in the original character creation.

2. Determine Stats

Similar to Classification and Element, Evolved Animon often inherit
the statistical strengths and weaknesses of their earlier Stages. If you
want to keep a similar Stat spread, simply distribute 2 extra points
among the Stats of the previous highest Stage (paying attention to the
maximum scores shown below for each Stage) and record the updated
totals on your character sheet.
In other cases, higher Stages might be very different in terms of Stats.
If you want a very different Stat spread, you can start from scratch.
When using this method, all Stats start at a base of 2. You then
distribute a number of points between them based on the Stage:

•

SUPER: Distribute 6 points among Stats. No Stat may be
higher than 5.

•

ULTRA: Distribute 8 points among Stats. No Stat may be
higher than 6.

•

GIGA: Distribute 10 points among Stats. No Stat may be
higher than 6.

063

3. Set new HP, Damage, Dodge, and Initiative

With increased Stats comes improved derived statistics.
The method for calculating HP is different depending on Stage:
• HP for SUPER Stage is equal to 10 + (4 x Heart).
• HP for ULTRA Stage is equal to 15 + (5 x Heart).
• HP for GIGA Stage is equal to 20 + (6 x Heart).
Damage is also calculated differently based on Stage:
• Damage for SUPER Stage is equal to 2 x Power.
• Damage for ULTRA Stage is equal to 3 x Power.
• Damage for GIGA Stage is equal to 4 x Power.
Dodge and Initiative are calculated in the same way as before:
• Dodge is equal to Agility.
• Initiative is equal to Brains.
Make sure to apply selected Score Improvements.

4. Choose new Signature Attack

Evolved Animon can use the Signature Attacks of earlier Stages, but
they also get a new one. This should have a different name and can
have a different Element and Effect as well. As before, the Brains
score determines the number of times they can use their Signature
Attacks in a single Combat Encounter. Using any Signature Attack,
including those from lower Stages, counts as a Use. The starting Rank
of a new Signature Attack is based on which Stage it is gained at:
• SUPER Stage Signature Attacks start at Rank 2.
• ULTRA Stage Signature Attacks start at Rank 3.
• GIGA Stage Signature Attacks start at Rank 4.

5. Choose a new Quality

Evolved Animon gain a brand new Rank 1 Quality that represents a
new advantageous aspect of their evolved form. Each Animon Stage can
have up to 2 Qualities, which apply at that Stage and all higher Stages.

6. Choose a Name

When an Animon Evolves they might go by a new name — at least
until they Devolve back to the earlier Stage. This will depend on the
rules and setting of the story your group is telling. Check with the GM
and the rest of the group to pick a suitable name.

064

PLAYING
THE GAME

065

TELLING

THE STORY
Once character creation is complete and each Player has a Kid
character and an Animon character (detailed up to the BASIC
Stage), you are ready to start playing! Usually you’ll spend some time
talking as a group about the background of your story and how each
of the kids gets involved in the events that unfold (for GMs planning
a story, you can find more info in the ‘Gamemaster’ section). After
that, the Players begin to play their characters, and the GM responds
and narrates what is going on in the world. This all takes place in a
kind of free-form conversation between everyone at the table.

The Conversation
Through the ongoing conversation, everyone in the game builds up a
consistent and evolving picture of what is happening and everyone
contributes to the developing story. At some point, the GM will
describe direct obstacles or problems that the PCs will need to
overcome. The game is split up into distinct Scenes, much like a TV
show or movie. Each Scene revolves around a particular location,
character, or event. Generally, the GM decides when one Scene ends
and another begins.
Where outcomes are uncertain, the Players attempt Tests by rolling
dice; the story will be guided by the successes and failures of the PCs.
Sometimes the PCs will encounter enemy Animon or other foes, in
which case a Combat Encounter is likely to break out. This is a Scene
involving a more structured form of gameplay in which the PC Animon
face off against tough opponents. Not everything in the story will be
fighting and facing danger, though! The Kids and Animon will all need
to rest and recuperate at some point. In these calm moments, PCs can
engage in various Rest Activities and chill out. All of these different
story and gameplay elements are described in the following sections.

066

Tests
Attempting Tests is something the PCs will be doing regularly in any
game of Animon Story. Whenever they face a challenge or make an
effort to overcome any kind of adversity, they attempt a Test. This is
explained in the ‘Core Mechanic’ section at the beginning of the book.
Both Kids and Animon can attempt Tests, and each uses their own
characteristics to assemble dice pools. If Kid and Animon partners are
cooperating on a task, the Kid’s characteristics are normally used to
assemble the dice pool unless the GM decides otherwise.
If a roll is failed, Players always have the option of Pushing it, which
gives them the chance to re-roll and perhaps succeed at the cost of
gaining Bond Strain.

Assembling a Dice Pool

The characteristics that contribute to a dice pool are different for Kid
and Animon characters. In either case, any characteristic that is useful
for attempting the Test at hand will contribute dice. Dice pools can
also be modified by spending Bond Points.
Kid dice pools are added to by the following characteristics:

•
•

TRAIT: A single Trait always adds dice to a Kid dice pool. This
represents the approach used to attempt the task. A number of
dice equal to the relevant Trait score are added to the pool.
TALENT: If the Player thinks one of their Kid’s Talents would be
useful and the GM agrees, a number of dice equal to the Talent
Rank are added to the pool.

Animon dice pools are added to by the following characteristics:

•
•
•

STAT: A single Stat always adds dice to an Animon dice pool,
whichever is needed most for overcoming the task at hand.
QUALITY: If the Player thinks one of their Animon’s Qualities
would be useful and the GM agrees, a number of dice equal to
the Quality Rank are added to the pool.
SIGNATURE ATTACK: If the Player thinks their Animon’s
Signature Attack would be useful and the GM agrees, a number
of dice equal to the Rank of the attack are added to the pool.

067

Difficulty Rating

Before a Player attempts a Test, the GM announces the Difficulty
Rating. This is the number of successes required to pass the Test. The
range of Difficulty Ratings is described in the following table:
1 - Simple

A straightforward task with a slim but present chance of failure.

2 - Standard

A challenging task which requires skill or effort to succeed.

3 - Tough

A daunting task with a high risk of failure for most.

4 - Severe

A very difficult task that few would even attempt.

5 - Extreme

Attempting this task is a terrifying prospect!

6+ - Almost
Impossible

Success seems completely out of reach — who could achieve
such a thing?

Opposed Tests

In some cases, two characters will be competing against one another in
a Test. This could involve anything from an arm wrestle to a game of
chess to one character attempting to lie to another. In cases where two
or more characters are directly contesting one another, instead of the
GM setting a Difficulty Rating, all characters involved assemble their
dice pools and roll an Opposed Test. The character who rolls the most
successes is the victor. If characters get an equal number of successes,
the GM can either declare a tie or immediately call for another roll.

Setback and Boost

Setback and Boost respectively increase or decrease the dice results
needed for successes (as described in the ‘Core Mechanic’ section).
When the GM decides that a factor in the story makes a task
significantly more complicated or grants a significant advantage, they
give Setback or Boost to Players attempting Tests. This factor could be
environmental, emotional, or physical; it might involve cooperation
between multiple characters or almost anything else! In particular, a
PC’s Harm often imposes Setback on their rolls.
Kid Type Features are one consistent way that PCs can gain Boost on
rolls, and Players can also add things to the story that might grant Boost
or Setback by spending Bond Points (see the ‘Bond Points’ section).

068

Pushing Rolls

If a PC just can’t afford to fail a crucial roll, they can force themselves
beyond their normal capabilities. This is called Pushing a roll. When
a Player decides to Push a roll, they immediately re-roll with the
same dice pool as before, including any bonus dice gained by
spending Bond Points, etc. They also immediately gain 1 Bond Strain,
as exerting such effort is bound to create stress! If the new result is a
success, they pass the Test as normal. If the new result is also a failure,
they are defeated by the task and cannot Push the roll again.

Failing Tests

When a PC fails a Test, they do not achieve what they set out to do. This
is not the same as ‘nothing happens.’ The story continues to evolve, just
not in the way the PC was hoping for. PCs shouldn’t be able to attempt
the same Test multiple times in a row without changing their approach,
or something in the scene changing around them.
Sometimes the GM may decide that failing a Test leads to a Kid losing
Stamina or Animon losing HP. For example, a Kid trying to climb
a steep, rocky outcrop would lose Stamina if they fail, slipping and
hurting themselves. Where appropriate, a good rule of thumb is that
characters will lose HP/Stamina equal to the Difficulty Rating of the
Test, though this should be modified based on the danger of the task.
In some cases, the GM may decide the consequences of failure are so
great it will lead to Harm (see the Harm section).

069

Combat

Encounters
Sometimes fights break out — and most Animon are well-equipped for
battling one another. In this game, it is very rare for Kids to be directly
involved in fighting, as it’s difficult for humans to cause Animon any
real damage. Animon fight to protect their Kid partners and keep them
out of danger (although they might not always succeed).
When a fight is about to start, it’s time for Players to roll Initiative;
the GM also rolls this for any NPCs (Non-Player Characters) involved,
including the enemies. This is the start of a Combat Encounter, in
which characters take Turns and try to win the battle.

Extended Action Scenes

Sometimes, the GM can declare an ‘Extended Action Scene,’ which is
like a longer version of a Combat Encounter that is split into sections,
or any intense sequence of events that takes place in a limited time.
Extended Action Scenes follow the same rules as Combat Encounters,
except PCs don’t regain Signature Attack Uses, or heal via ‘Catching
Your Breath’ until the very end.

Initiative
All Animon characters involved in a Combat Encounter roll for
Initiative. This is an Opposed Test using the Initiative score.
Characters who are surprised (such as the victims of an ambush) roll
with Setback. Like with any Test, useful Qualities can be used to add
dice to the roll. An Initiative Order is then created based on the
number of successes rolled with the most successful character acting
first. Ties in Initiative rolls are always won by the PCs. Players
continue to take turns in the Initiative Order until the character with
the lowest Initiative score has acted, at which point the next ‘round’ of
turns is started with the top character.

070

Taking a Turn
On their turn, each Animon character can make an Action. This is
more or less anything that involves a dice roll — attempting a Test
or making an Attack. Things like speaking, moving a short distance,
or simple interactions with the environment do not take an Action.
Importantly, Animon can also Evolve without using an Action. At the
same time as their Animon partner, Kids can also take an Action if
there is something they want to do; otherwise, it’s assumed they are
standing by and cheering on their Animon. Players can also decide to
‘delay’ their turn until later in the Initiative Order, in which case they
will act at that point in all future rounds (unless they delay again).

Attacking and Defending
Animon will often use their Action to attack enemies in order to
reduce them to 0HP and knock them out. When a PC attacks, the
Player chooses a Target, builds a dice pool and makes an Attack roll.
The result is compared to a Dodge roll made by their opponent. Like
with Tests, Players can Push Attack or Dodge rolls, or spend Bond
Points on them. If the attacker rolls equal to or more than the number
of successes rolled by the defender (as long as they rolled at least 1
success), the attack hits and deals damage.

071

When an NPC attacks a PC, the GM uses the NPC’s statblock to
determine the dice pool rolled for the attack, which is opposed by a
Dodge roll from the Player. If the defender rolls more than the number
of successes rolled by the attacker, the attack misses and no damage is
dealt. Player Animon can choose to spend their whole Action focusing
on defence, which grants them Boost on any Dodge rolls made until the
beginning of their next turn.

Attacker Dice Pools

Attacker dice pools are added to by the following characteristics:

•

072

STAT: A single Stat always adds dice to an Attack roll. The Stat
used is based on the nature and circumstances of the attack.

›

Use Power to attack when the target is close and there is
a clear shot, such as when fighting at very short range, or
when there’s an opening in the target’s defences.

›

Use Heart to attack when you purposefully put yourself
in harm’s way or when the target has you on the back
foot, such as when you are overwhelmed or outnumbered.

›

Use Brains to attack when you must use precision or
when you attack from a secure position, such as when the
target is some distance away from you.

›

Use Agility to attack when you move to close the
distance or keep up with the target, or when you need to
attack stealthily.

•

SIGNATURE ATTACK: If an Animon uses their Signature
Attack, they add a number of dice equal to the Rank of the
Signature Attack to the roll. Remember that Animon can only
use their Signature Attack if they have remaining Uses left.

•

QUALITY: If an Animon uses one or more Qualities to attack,
they add a number of dice equal to the Rank of the Qualities to
the Attack roll.

Defender Dice Pools

Defender dice pools are added to by the following characteristics:

•

DODGE: A number of dice equal to an Animon’s Dodge score
is always added to any Dodge rolls they make.

•

QUALITY: If an Animon uses one or more Qualities to avoid
attacks or defend themselves, they add a number of dice equal
to the Rank of the Qualities to the Defence roll.

Setback and Boost

Setback and Boost can be added to Attack or Dodge rolls in the
following ways:

•

ELEMENT: If an attacker’s Element is strong against the
defender, the Attack roll gains Boost. If the defender’s Element is
strong against the attacker, the Attack roll instead gains Setback.
If an attacker is using their Signature Attack, they compare the
Element of that Signature Attack to the defender, instead of
using their own Innate Element.
Refer to page 42 (or the quick reference sheet) for the elemental
matchup triangles.

For example, an Animon with an Innate Water Element is attacking a
target with an Innate Nature Element. Water is weak against Nature, so
this attack has Setback. If instead the attacking Animon uses a Signature
Ability with the Fire Element, the attack would have Boost, because Fire is
strong against Nature.

073

•

STAGE: If the attacking Animon is one Stage below the
defender, the attack has Setback. If the attacking Animon
is one Stage above the defender, the attack has Boost. If the
Animon are two or more Stages apart, the attack has Double
Setback or Double Boost depending on if the attacker is the
lower or higher Stage Animon, respectively. Stage differences
never modify Dodge rolls.

•

DEFENCE ACTION: PCs may choose to make no Action on
their turn other than to brace themselves for an attack. In this
case, they gain Boost on all Defence rolls until the
beginning of their next turn.

•

OTHER: The GM can decide if a factor is helping or hindering
a character enough to grant them Setback or Boost on their
rolls in Combat Encounters, including Attack or Dodge rolls.

There is no such thing as ‘attack range’ or ‘movement speed’ in this
game. In a Combat Encounter, characters are assumed to be close
enough to move and attack enemies unless the GM says they are too
far away. In those cases, the GM will state how many turns it will
take to close the distance, or ask for the character to attempt a Test to
quickly dash to where they need to be.

074

Damage

When an Animon successfully makes an Attack roll, they deal damage
to the defender. The amount of damage dealt is equal to the attacker’s
Damage score. On top of that, the attacker deals extra damage equal
to the difference between the Attack and Dodge roll results. If Kids ever
deal damage, they do so in the same way as Animon, as if they have a
Damage score of 1.
For example, an attacking Animon rolls an Attack roll with 4 dice and
rolls 5, 4, 4, and 1: a result of 3 successes. Their target rolls a Dodge roll
with 3 dice and rolls 4, 2, and 2: a result of only 1 success, which means
they fail to dodge the attack. The attacking Animon’s Damage score is 6,
and as they rolled 2 more successes than the defender, they deal 2 extra
damage. Therefore the attack deals a total of 8 damage.
When a character is reduced to 0HP or 0 Stamina, they are out of the
fight. In the case of PCs, this usually means they are unconscious or
totally exhausted. When a PC is reduced to 0HP/Stamina, they
immediately add 1 point to the Critical Gauge and also gain a
Harm (see the ‘Harm’ section). PC Animon of SUPER Stage or higher
are forced to Devolve when reduced to 0HP, as described in the
‘Devolution’ section.
When an NPC is reduced to 0HP, they are either knocked unconscious
or, in the case of Animon, they might be destroyed, depending on the
circumstances.

Can characters die?
Kid characters can never die in Animon Story. This is not to say
they are immortal, but the death of a Kid character is subject
matter much darker than is intended for Animon Story. When
Animon are destroyed, their essence returns to their world and is
reconstituted into a new Animon egg, which will soon hatch into a
new FLEDGLING Stage Animon. In this way, they never truly die
either, but can still be ‘lost’ to a degree.

075

Conditions
Sometimes characters will be inflicted with conditions, which affect
their ability to fight. Conditions are all negative, aside from the
Boosted Condition. Here is a list of all Conditions in the game:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Poisoned: Until the Combat Encounter is over, a Poisoned
character takes an amount of damage at the end of their turn
equal to the Power (or Skill Score for NPCs) of the poisoner.
Stunned: A Stunned character misses their next turn.
Disoriented: A Disoriented character has Setback on any
Attack rolls they make.
Weakened: A Weakened character has any damage they deal
reduced by half.
Vulnerable: A Vulnerable character has Setback on any Dodge
rolls they make.
Immobilised: An Immobilised character cannot move, but
they can still make an Action on their turn.
Incapacitated: An Incapacitated character cannot move or
make Actions, and is also considered Vulnerable.
Boosted: A Boosted character gains Boost on all their rolls
during their next turn.

The Critical Gauge & Critical Moves
During each Combat Encounter, Players add to the Critical Gauge
as tension rises to a climax, at which point they can unleash powerful
Critical Moves. Whenever a Player rolls a 6 in a Combat Encounter
(including the Initiative roll), they add 1 point to the Critical Gauge,
regardless of whether the roll was successful or not. If a Player rolls
multiple 6s on a single roll, they add 1 point for each 6 rolled.
Whenever a PC is reduced to 0HP/Stamina, they also add 1 point to the
Critical Gauge. This can be tracked with tokens or dice.

076

When the Critical Gauge reaches its point limit, the PCs can decide to
use a ‘Critical Move,’ a powerful action which will tip the odds of any
situation in their favour. The Critical Gauge point limit is equal to 2 x
the number of people in your group (including both the GM and the
Players). The Critical Gauge starts at 0 in each new Combat Encounter,
and is reset to 0 after a Critical Move is used.

Critical Moves don’t have to be used as soon as the Critical Gauge is
filled, but they’re lost when the Combat Encounter ends. Dice rolled
as part of a Critical Move can never add points to the Critical Gauge.
Whenever PCs use a Critical Move, the Players select one of the
following options:

•

•
•

•

Critical Combo Attack: The PC Animon use their Signature
Attacks in unison to bring down an enemy. The Player who
triggers this Critical Move uses their action and picks a target
for the attack, then each PC Animon in the Combat Encounter
makes an Attack roll against the same target using their
Signature Attack (though this doesn’t count as a Use). The
target’s Dodge roll must be made with one Setback (ignoring all
other sources of Setback and Boost). Each successful Attack roll
deals damage as usual.
Critical Evolution: The PC Animon conjure the energy to
Evolve to face a crisis. Each PC Animon may Evolve to their
highest available Stage without the need to spend Bond Points
or gain any required Bond Strain.
Critical Success: Even the impossible can be achieved with
commitment and a little luck. A PC may automatically pass a
single Test without the need to roll. The Players must all agree
on which PC and which Test this Critical Move is used on
(This cannot be used on an attack roll).
Critical Threat: Something terrible happens but the PCs are
resolved to deal with it together. All PCs have their Bond Points
fully restored. The GM describes how a current problem gets
tremendously worse, or how a new and unforeseen problem
becomes a major threat.

Catching Your Breath
A Combat Encounter ends when there is no longer an active and
pressing threat to the PCs. At this point, the Animon characters
(including those who have been reduced to 0HP) can all catch their
breath — they regain HP equal to 1 + their Heart score.
Kids don’t recover as rapidly as Animon, so they cannot restore lost
Stamina without properly Resting (see ‘Rest and Recovery’).

077

the going

gets tough
Harm
Harm represents the bad things that happen to Kids and Animon
which have lasting and sometimes profound effects. This could be
anything from a sprained ankle that makes it hard to walk, to a deep
feeling of hopelessness that makes it hard to fight on. Beacause of
their close bond, Harm is experienced in some way by both Kid and
Animon partners, even if it only directly impacts one of them.

Suffering Harm

Whenever a character suffers Harm, it is recorded on their character
sheet until it is healed. Throughout an Animon Story, there are three
main ways for characters to suffer Harm:

•

When a Kid is reduced to 0 Stamina or their Animon partner
is reduced to 0HP, they immediately suffer a related Harm.

•

If Bond Strain is increased above a PC’s remaining number of
Bond Points, they immediately suffer a related Harm (unless
they already have a Harm gained this way).

•

The GM can decide that failing a particular Test will result in
a related Harm.

As soon as a character suffers a Harm, they also immediately gain a
number of Bond Strain equal to the Severity of the Harm (see the
following page), unless Bond Strain was the source of the Harm.
If a character suffers Harm but doesn’t have enough empty Harm slots
to record it, they immediately gain a number of Bond Strain equal to
2 + the Severity of the Harm.

078

Severity and Recording Harm

The character sheet has three Harm slots, which are filled out when
either a Kid or their Animon partner suffers a Harm. Generally each
Harm a character suffers fills one slot and is referred to as ‘Severity 1,’
but if the source of the Harm is particularly terrible the GM can decide
that a Harm is Severity 2 (fills 2 slots) or, in the worst case scenario,
even Severity 3 (fills all three slots)!
To fill out a Harm slot, the Player and GM decide how best to
describe the Harm, then the Player writes a descriptive name or
phrase in a free Harm slot (or slots). The description of the Harm very
much depends on its source. Here are some examples:

•

Injured (sprained ankle/
broken arm/badly bruised)

•

Hopeless

•

Afraid (of the darkness/of
the enemy/of failure)

•

Guilty Conscience

•

Extremely Stressed

•

Miserable

•

Deeply Upset

•

Starving

•

Utterly Exhausted

Becoming Shaken

If all of a PC’s Harm slots are full, they have been Shaken and the
Player marks this on their character sheet. While Shaken, both the
Kid and the Animon are so overcome or demoralised by their
Harm that they will struggle to succeed, or even attempt, most tasks.
Any rolls made by Shaken characters have Setback.

Healing Harm

Harm must be addressed individually to be healed. Often, this can
be done during Rests by taking the time to heal injuries, calm
emotions, or make up with friends. This is described in the ‘Rest and
Recovery’ section. A Shaken PC who heals at least one Harm is no
longer considered Shaken.

079

Rest and Recovery
Going on adventures, battling enemies, and solving problems is tiring
work, and at some point the PCs are going to need to Rest. To Rest
properly, it takes more than a quick breather. The characters will
need to stop what they’re doing and chill out, perhaps eating or even
sleeping. In this game, meaningful Rest needs to be at least a couple
of uninterrupted hours, but it could be a full evening and a night of
sleep, depending on the circumstances. If the PCs rest for more than a
day, or rest in a very comfortable place, they may gain the benefits of a
Full Recovery instead of a normal Rest Activity.
Whenever characters Rest, they may immediately benefit in the three
following ways:

•

Kids reset their Stamina to half their maximum if they have
fallen below that point. If not, they regain no Stamina.

•

Animon regain a number of lost HP in the same way as ‘catching their breath’ after a Combat Encounter — they regain HP
equal to 1 + their Heart score.

•

If Kids and Animon are together while Resting, they regain 1
lost Bond Point.

Rest Activities

During a period of Rest, PCs can engage in a single Rest Activity,
which provides an additional benefit. Rest Activities are things that
Kid and Animon partners do together to help them recover, relax, and
prepare themselves for whatever comes next. As long as they aren’t
interrupted, PCs can choose one of the following:

080

•

Recuperate: The partners fully restore themselves by chilling
out, eating a hearty meal, sleeping restfully, or some other
restorative activity. All the PC’s lost Stamina and HP points
are recovered.

•

Socialise: The partners play, chat, or otherwise spend time
bonding with one another and perhaps the rest of the group.
They regain 1 lost Bond Point.

•

De-stress: The partners calm themselves through personal
meditation or conversation with one another, perhaps
apologising for mistakes they have made. The Player rolls a
single D6. If the result is a success (4+) their Bond Strain is
reduced by 1. Bond Strain cannot be reduced below the
combined Severity of all the characters’ Harm in this way.

•

Make a Plan: if the characters know they have a difficult task
ahead of them and have some information about what they
need to do, they can take time to make a plan. The Player
describes a specific obstacle they expect to encounter based on
information they’ve gathered. They attempt a Difficulty 2 Test
using Logic or Brains. If they succeed, they can grant Boost
to rolls that any characters make to overcome that obstacle as
long as it is exactly as described (for example a lock with a
specific puzzle, a wall with a hidden door, or a maze with a
single correct path).

•

Address Harm: the characters try to rid themselves of a Harm
they’ve experienced, either by healing physical injuries or
overcoming emotional ones. The GM decides the most
appropriate Trait or Stat based on the Harm, and the character
attempts a Test with a Difficulty Rating equal to 1 + the Harm’s
Severity. If it’s appropriate, another character can attempt this
Test for them (for example, if they are helping patch up injuries).
The helper does not have to choose this Rest Activity.

081

Full Recovery

When the PCs are able to rest for an extended period of time (a couple
of days at least), or in a particularly safe and comfortable location, they
gain the benefits of a Full Recovery. Instead of choosing a Rest
Activity, PCs regain all lost HP/Stamina, and remove all Harm. If the
PCs get into any kind of action, including Combat Encounters, during
this time, they lose the benefits of the Full Recovery.

Other Healing Sources

Certain Talents, Qualities, or other characteristics might offer healing
effects. The GM might also decide to introduce healing items such
as potions, healing herbs, or medicine. In these cases, a suitable Test
should be attempted against Difficulty Rating 1. On a successful roll,
the target of the healing regains a number of HP or Stamina equal to
the Rank of the related Talent/Quality, plus 1 extra HP or Stamina for
each success rolled past the first. In the case of healing items, the GM
should decide a standard amount of healing to be used in place of a
Talent/Quality Rank when a healing Test is successful.

Healing Across Multiple Stages

Sometimes an Animon may have taken damage at multiple Stages.
When rolling for any healing, the roll is made using the Stats of the
Animon’s current Stage. On a successful roll, the same amount of
HP is applied to all Stages that have taken damage, up to each Stage’s
maximum HP value.

082

Bonds of

friendship
Bond Points
Bond Points are a special resource that only the PCs have. They are
the heroes of any Animon Story and Bond Points are one of the things
that separate them from any other characters. Players can spend
Bond Points in various useful ways. This represents the sheer power
of the bond between partners helping them overcome any challenge.
All characters start with a maximum of 6 Bond Points. This is increased
by 1 every time the Bond Level is increased. As long as they have at least
1 Bond Point left, Players can spend them for the following boons:

•
•
•
•
•

Better Odds: Spend 1 Bond Point to gain 2 dice on ANY roll.
Spend 2 Bond Points to gain 3 dice, 3 Bond Points for 4 dice,
and so on.
Dig Deep: Spend 1 Bond Point to gain an extra Use when an
Animon has run out of Signature Attack Uses.
Interject: Spend 2 Bond Points to make an immediate extra
action in combat (or in other circumstances where no action
would normally be possible).
Fight On: Spend 3 Bond Points when a character would be
reduced to 0 Stamina/HP. That character is instead reduced to
1 Stamina/HP.
Lucky Break: Spend 1-3 Bond Points based on GM discretion
to add a change to the story. Perhaps you have just the right
item in your bag; the enemy you want to hit with an electric
attack is standing in a puddle of water; a rockslide blocks the
gorge you’re running through giving you time to escape the
angry stampede behind. The cost will be higher for changes
that are improbable or extremely convenient — the GM has
the final say on what constitutes a reasonable change. In some
cases this can provide Boost or remove Setback from rolls.

083

Kids’ Special Items allow a ‘free’ Bond Point spend if they are used
in a significant way. This means they get to choose one of the above
boons that costs 1 Bond Point without actually spending the point.
They can also choose to spend their Bond Points in coordination with
using the ‘free’ Special Item point to get more expensive boons.
Once spent, Bond Points can be recovered through Resting and
Levelling Up. When the characters Rest, they regain 1 Bond Point
(or more depending on their Rest Activity). When a character’s Bond
Level increases, their Bond Points are restored to the new maximum.

Bond Strain
While Bond Points represent the incredible power that comes from
the bond between partners, Bond Strain represents that power being
misdirected and the bond itself being put under pressure. Like Bond
Points and Bond Level, Bond Strain is shared between Kid and
Animon partners.
All characters start with 0 Bond Strain, but this will increase at certain
stressful points throughout the story. There are three ways in which
a character’s Bond Strain can increase:

•
•
•
•

Harm: Whenever a character suffers a Harm, they
immediately gain an amount of Bond Strain equal to the
Severity of the Harm (i.e. how many slots it takes up), unless
Bond Strain was the source of that Harm.
Pushing Rolls: Whenever a Player decides to Push a roll, their
characters immediately gain 1 Bond Strain.
Evolution: If Animon Evolve without Rest, having previously
Evolved to their highest Stage, they gain 1 Bond Strain.
Desire: Whenever a Kid character pursues their Desire in a
way that causes problems for their partner or the other PCs,
they immediately gain 1 Bond Strain (and 1XP).

If a PC’s Bond Strain ever reaches a higher value than their maximum
Bond Points, they have a Bond Break Episode, as described in the
following section. Whenever a Bond Break Episode is resolved, those
PCs have their Bond Strain reduced to 0. Bond Strain can also be
reduced steadily through Resting.

084

Bond Break Episodes
A Bond Break Episode is the specific moment when the bond
between Kid and Animon partners is put to the test in a major way. In
Animon Story, the bond can never truly break — Kids and Animon
always eventually overcome these Bond Break Episodes and, in doing
so, learn valuable lessons about friendship, becoming wiser and more
powerful than they were before.
A Bond Break Episode is triggered when a character’s Bond Strain is
higher than their maximum number of Bond Points. If this happens,
the Player in question discusses what happens next with the GM. This
is often based on what caused the Bond Break Episode to happen,
such as a Harm or other particular source of Bond Strain. Here are
some examples:

•
•
•

An Animon pushes themselves too hard and suffers a bad injury.
Their Kid partner gets angry at how reckless they’re being and
the two fall out.
A Kid selfishly pursues their Desire in a way that causes some
trouble for the whole group. Their Animon is upset and vows to
stop being their partner until they ‘grow up.’
A Kid pushes their Animon too hard in a fight, which results in a
dangerous situation. The Kid is mortified with their own actions
and refuses to let the Animon fight again.

085

While experiencing a Bond Break Episode, characters cannot spend
or gain Bond Points, or reduce their Bond Strain in any way. They
also cannot engage in any Rest Activities. Until the episode is
resolved, the GM takes more-or-less full control of the Animon
character (after discussing with the Player how the episode should
play out in general). In some cases, particularly Bond Break Episodes
revolving around a Combat Encounter, the Animon may undergo
a ‘Dark Evolution,’ which results in them Evolving into a temporary,
monstrous higher Stage and losing control of themselves, possibly
putting the group in danger. If this happens, the GM and Player can
work together to build an NPC Statblock for the Dark Evolution. This
can be used in a tense confrontation, where the other PCs have to face
off against a dark form of their friend.
At some point all PCs will see the error of their ways and the Bond
Break Episode will be resolved. This should be an appropriately
dramatic, personal, or touching narrative moment depending on
the circumstances of the story so far. When a Bond Break Episode is
resolved, the characters immediately reset their Bond Strain to 0 and
gain 5XP. Characters also immediately remove Harm that was gained
via Bond Strain increasing.
If they meet the level requirements, the resolution of a Bond Break
Episode can be the perfect time for an Animon PC to Evolve to their
next Stage for the first time!

086

using the

ani-tool
The Ani-Tool is a multi-purpose device that all Kids with Animon
partners have or receive early on in the story. Depending on the setting
of your Animon Story, these might be common electronic devices that
many people use, or they could be mysterious and rare, only found by
(or given to) the chosen few. Rather than electronic devices, they might
be magical items given power by strange crystals or glowing runes. This
is for the group to decide during character creation. When the Kids
receive their Ani-Tools, they should note it down in the ‘Stuff’ section.
At the start of the story they have a limited number of functions, but as
the characters explore and grow they will have opportunities to
upgrade them. Ani-Tools always start with the following functions:

•

Allow travel into the world(s) where Animon originate based on
specific criteria defined by the GM, based on the story setting.

•

Allow Animon partner Evolution if all the requirements are met.

The following is a list of Ani-Tool functions that can be unlocked
when the GM presents an opportunity. The GM is also encouraged
to make up new Ani-Tool functions that fit in with the setting and
story of the group. Whenever Ani-Tool functions are unlocked or
improved, all Kid PCs get the new function or level at the same time,
so there is no need for each Player to individually note them on their
character sheet, as long as the GM or the group as a whole keeps a list
of unlocked functions. Some functions have various levels which need
to be unlocked separately:

•

Utility: The Ani-Tool can be used for a number of different
mundane functions, to help the Kids on their adventures. This
includes telling the time, indicating direction like a compass,
and shining a light like a torch.

087

088

•

Detect: The Ani-Tool can detect the location of other Ani-Tools.
This usually only works with Ani-Tools belonging to other PCs.
› Level 1 - the detect function works over short distances.
› Level 2 - the detect function works over long distances.
› Level 3 - the detect function works on any Ani-Tool, not
just those belonging to the PCs.

•

Communicator: The Ani-Tool can be used to communicate
with other Ani-Tool holders, like a phone or a walkie-talkie.
› Level 1 - the comms function works over short distances.
› Level 2 - the comms function works over long distances.
› Level 3 - the comms function works between the human
world and the Animon world.

•

Map: The Ani-Tool can display or project a map of any area the
PCs have visited (or been given map information for).
› Level 1 - the map function shows geography.
› Level 2 - the map function displays information about
terrain, climate, and even local populations.

•

Storage: The Ani-Tool can shrink and store things inside itself.
› Level 1 - the storage function works on small objects.
› Level 2 - the storage function works on partner Animon,
allowing them to ‘hide’ inside the Ani-Tool.

•

Booster: The Ani-Tool can temporarily boost the power of a
partner Animon. Once per Combat Encounter, use this function
to give the holder’s partner Animon the Boosted Condition.

•

Ani-Scanner: The Ani-Tool can be used to scan and record
information about Animon encountered by the holder.
› Level 1 - the Ani-Scanner reveals and records the species/
name and current Stage of a scanned Animon.
› Level 2 - the Ani-Scanner reveals and records the
Classification of a scanned Animon.
› Level 3 - the Ani-Scanner reveals and records the
Element of a scanned Animon.
› Level 4 - the Ani-Scanner reveals and records the
Qualities of a scanned Animon.
› Level 5 - the Ani-Scanner reveals and records the
Signature Attack of a scanned Animon.

XP and

levelling up

089

growing

stronger
XP (experience points) are a measure of how much the characters
have learned and grown. They are earned in a few different ways while
playing and, as characters earn XP, they will get stronger, gain new
abilities, and Level Up by increasing their Bond Level.
XP represents the growth of both Kid characters and their Animon
partners, so they share the same XP ‘track.’ When characters reach 5XP,
they can choose a new Minor Upgrade. When characters reach 10XP,
they Level Up, which increases their Bond Level by 1 and they also
choose a new Major Upgrade. After that, the XP track is set back to 0.

090

Earning XP
Throughout the game, PCs can earn XP in the following ways, or at any
other point the GM decides to award it:

•

Natural Growth: PCs gain 1XP at the end of every play session.

•

Virtues: Sometimes Kid characters will have their Virtue tested.
When they struggle to uphold it in difficult circumstances but
stay true to themselves, they gain 1XP.

•

Desires: The wish to attain a particular goal can be
overwhelming. When a Kid character pursues their Desire in a
way that causes serious problems for their partner, or the other
PCs, they gain 1XP (and 1 Bond Strain).

•

Bond Break Episodes: Sometimes the bond between Kid
and Animon is put to the ultimate test. When characters come
through a Bond Break Episode and resolve it, they gain 5XP.

•

Victories: Even challenges that seem insurmountable at first can
be overcome with the right approach. When characters defeat a
powerful and significant enemy, or achieve a long-term
objective, they gain between 1-3XP depending on how difficult
and important an achievement it was. The exact amount is
decided by the GM based on the following guidelines
(remembering that they are only guidelines):
XP for Victories

XP Gain

Scale of Achievement

1

Defeating a significant foe that was causing the group a lot of
trouble, or achieving a goal that took 1-2 sessions of play.

2

Defeating a very powerful foe, such as a villain’s top
‘henchmon’, or achieving a goal that took 3-4 sessions of play.

3

Defeating an extremely powerful foe, such as the main villain
of the current adventure, or achieving a goal that took 5+
sessions of play.

091

Minor Upgrades
When PCs reach the 5XP point on the XP track, they immediately get a
new Minor Upgrade. Note that this does not reset their XP to 0;
characters continue to gain XP from this point until they reach 10XP.
At 5XP, Players choose a Minor Upgrade from the following options:

•

Increase the Rank of a single Talent by 1 (up to a maximum
Rank of 3).

•

Increase the Rank of a single Quality by 1 (up to a maximum
Rank of 3).

Major Upgrades and Levelling Up
When characters reach 10XP on the XP track, they increase their
Bond Level by 1, get a new Major Upgrade, and then reset their XP
track to 0. This is called Levelling Up. Kids’ Stamina and the Bond
Points maximum are both increased by 1 at the same time as Bond
Level. PCs recover all lost Bond Points (up to their new maximum).
When characters Level Up, the Players choose a Major Upgrade from
the following list. PCs may not take the same Major Upgrade twice in
a row. Note that Players may choose to take a Minor Upgrade when
Levelling Up instead of a Major Upgrade:

092

•

Gain a new Talent at Rank 1 (perhaps something the Kid
might have learned in the story so far).

•

Gain a new Quality at Rank 1, at BASIC Stage or higher, as
long as the Stage is available (each Animon Stage can have 2
Qualities, which apply at that Stage and all higher Stages).

•

Gain a new Effect on any Signature Attack (each Signature
Attack can have up to 3 Effects).

•

Increase the Rank of a BASIC or SUPER Stage Signature
Attack by 1 (up to a maximum Rank of 3).

Score Improvements
At Levels 2, 4, 6, and 8, PCs grow stronger by gaining Score
Improvements. Players choose one of the following options. Players
may not take the same Score Improvement twice in a row:

•

Increase the Animon’s Maximum HP by 5.

•

Increase the Animon’s Damage score by 2.

•

Increase the Animon’s Dodge score by 1.

•

Increase both the Animon’s Initiative score and Signature
Attack Uses by 1.

These improvements apply to all Animon Stages, even those that have
not yet been unlocked, so Players should make a note of which
improvements they have selected for future reference. One good way of
doing this is making a small note in the relevant sections for Stages that
have not yet been unlocked. Also remember that new Stages are
unlocked at levels 3, 6, and 9!

093

Reaching Level 10
Bond Level 10 is the highest level in the game under normal
circumstances. If your group has reached Level 10 and want to keep
playing, it’s recommended to start a new story with fresh characters
(you could even have an Epilogue, and show how the new characters
follow in the old ones’ footsteps). If you really want to keep
playing with the same characters, you can simply keep counting XP
and Levelling Up beyond 10; however, you will find that the game is
quite different with such powerful PCs.
My character has changed
In some rare cases, Players may decide that something on their
character sheet is out of date and is no longer representative of the
character as they have developed through the story. In this case,
Players should discuss these things with the GM when the character
Levels Up and, if they both agree, certain parts of the character sheet
can be changed. In particular, a Kid’s Flaw, Desire, or Relationships
could feasibly change over time as they grow.

094

BEING THE

GAMEMASTER

The role

of the GM
The Gamemaster’s role is different to that of the other people playing.
Rather than taking on the role of a particular character, the GM is the
one who controls the actions of all Non-Player Characters (NPCs),
including anyone that the PCs talk to, fight, or engage with in any way.
The Gamemaster can be seen as the main narrator of the story, as
they respond and react to whatever the PCs do or say. They help guide
the story onwards by listening to what the Players are saying and
setting Scenes that the PCs can interact with, including those that
present challenges, problems, or opponents that need to be overcome.
As the GM, you’ll also occasionally inhabit the characters of the PC
Animon, particularly when Players want to have in-character
conversations between their Kids and Animon. Always remember
that the Players have agency over their Animon characters, and they
should be the ones to decide how their Animon speak and act. Ask
the Players about these things regularly, so that you can accurately
portray their characters when necessary!
A note on roleplaying
Some people prefer not to act out actions and conversations with their
characters in first person, instead narrating everything in third person.
As the GM, you shouldn’t force Players into acting out conversations,
even between their Kid and their Animon. You could instead ‘sum
up’ the conversation between characters, discussing how things went,
without diving into full-on roleplay.

096

Running the Game
If you’re the GM, it’s very important to remember that you’re not ‘in
charge’ of the story. While you may prepare certain elements of each
game session ahead of time, it is truly the actions of the PCs that
decide the direction of the story. The PCs are the main characters, and
everything that happens in the game serves to tell an interesting and
fun story about them!
You can think of your main role as the GM in the following way:

•

When the Players describe their characters’ actions, speak to
NPCs, or ask questions about the scene, it’s your job to describe
what happens next.

‘What happens next’ will vary massively depending on the current
scenario. Generally it will involve one of the following things:

•

You play the role of a partner Animon or an NPC and act out an
in-character conversation or other interaction with the Players
(or sum up the conversation in third person).

•

You describe the Scene around the PCs and how it changes
based on their actions, then ask what they do next.

•

You bring a fitting end to the current Scene and describe the
opening of a new one.

•

You present a challenge or obstacle that stands in the way of
the PCs achieving something, and ask how they respond.

•

You state that overcoming a challenge or obstacle will require
the PCs to attempt a Test; you set a Difficulty Rating, and
together with the Players determine which Traits, Talents, Stats,
Qualities, etc. will have an impact on the dice roll.

•

You decide that NPCs are determined to oppose the PCs
directly, so a Combat Encounter begins. You then call for
Initiative rolls and describe how the PCs’ opponents act and
fight, following the rules for resolving Combat Encounters.

097

It’s often the case that, as the GM, you’ll be the one who is most familiar
with the rules of the game. Especially early on, it’s very useful for you
to have a solid understanding of the various rules so that you can help
guide new Players. In particular, when Combat Encounters occur, you’ll
need to have a good understanding of the rules in order to effectively
control the NPC opponents that the PCs are fighting.
What makes a good story?
Whatever happens in the story, you should always think about what
makes for an interesting and fun storytelling experience. Players may
have particular Scenes they’d like to play out with their characters,
or perhaps they will start to take the story in a direction you weren’t
expecting. In these cases, it’s important to adapt and improvise, and
make sure the PCs are always at the heart of the story. In particular,
the story should present opportunities for the PCs to be challenged
in personal ways, especially involving the Kids’ Desires. These things
shouldn’t be happening every 5 minutes, but as characters face and
react to these sorts of personal challenges, they can develop, learn,
and grow — this is ultimately what any Animon Story is about.

Your Animon Story Setting
All Animon stories are about kids and monsters becoming partners
who learn and grow together. Beyond that, there aren’t many specific
assumptions made about the nature of the world in which your stories
take place. The game rules determine certain things, but there is a
huge amount of room to make up your own worlds. This is an
excellent thing to do as a group before going through the process to
create characters — that way everyone has some understanding of the
world their characters will inhabit.
When thinking about the setting for your story, you may find it useful
to answer the four questions on the following pages, then develop the
ideas from there.

098

1. Where do Animon come from?

Animon are not native to the human world. Exactly where they come
from is up to you. The homeworld of Animon is somehow linked
with the human world but it is likely very unfamiliar, perhaps utterly
bizarre, to any humans who go there. Animon may in fact come from
multiple worlds, all linked together. Consider the following options:

•

The world of Animon is a digital reflection of the human world, a
realm within cyberspace. Animon are sentient computer programs
with physical bodies.

•

The world of Animon is a fairytale ‘Otherworld’ full of magic and
mystery. Animon are fey monsters like those found in folktales.

•

The worlds of Animon are formed from the souls of humans. Each
human has a ‘soul world’ inside them. Animon are manifestations
of human psyches.

2. How are Animon involved in the story?

The type of world Animon come from is likely to determine a lot
about how they’re involved with the story. The degree to which they
have contact with humans, and the ways humans and Animon
interact, could be drastically different from one setting to the next.
This is also something that could change throughout the course of a
story. Consider the following options:

•

Most of humanity has no idea Animon even exist. Travel between
the human world and the Animon world is impossible under
normal circumstances.

•

Animon are known only in rumours by most, and few people have
actually encountered them. Portals or links between the human
world and the Animon world can sometimes be found.

•

Animon are abundant in the world. Most people have an Animon
partner and there are also ‘wild’ Animon that come through
portals to the human world.

099

3. Where do the Kids live?

The story won’t necessarily revolve around the Kids’ home, although
that is quite possible. In either case, the Kids’ home determines quite a
few things about how the adventure will unfold. Consider the
following options:

•

The Kids live in Tokyo, Japan in the mid-1990s.

•

The Kids live wherever you and the other players live in the
modern day.

•

The Kids live in a totally fictional world, perhaps with fantasy or
sci-fi features.

4. How are the Kids involved in the story?

Of course, at some point the Kids will meet their partner Animon
and get wrapped up into the story as it progresses. Exactly how this
happens can determine a lot about the nature of the story; it might
even change throughout the course of the story. The involvement of
the Kids will also help determine if the story takes the form of a long
continuous adventure, or smaller ‘episodic’ stories which all link
together. Consider the following options:

100

•

The Kids get mysteriously transported to the Animon world and
meet their partners. They must work together to survive and find
a way home!

•

Animon start appearing and causing trouble near the Kids’
home. For one reason or another, they and their partners are the
only ones who can solve this developing crisis.

•

The Kids set out on a journey to become the ultimate Animon
Masters! They must train and battle in order to become strong
enough to enter the Animon Champion League.

Planning an Adventure
A single contained story is often referred to as an adventure. In an
adventure, the PCs become involved in a series of events, leading to a
problem they need to solve. One adventure might start and end in a
single session of play, or it might be played out over multiple sessions.
If you’re the GM, there are some things you can plan beforehand to help
make things easier for yourself in the game sessions, but it’s important
not to worry too much about every minute detail. Being flexible and
learning to improvise are very useful skills, and combined with a certain
amount of planning, they’ll help ensure the story progresses smoothly.
Before starting a new adventure, think about the following things:

•
•
•
•

•

The Hook: What pulls the PCs into this adventure? They might
witness a related event or meet someone with new information.
Somehow they find out what’s going on and get involved.
The Problem: What has happened, or is going to happen, that
requires attention? Perhaps it’s a new villain causing trouble, a
mystery that needs solving, or an approaching disaster that must
be averted. There may even be multiple problems!
Locations: Where will this adventure take place? Plan for a few
key locations that you expect the PCs will visit. Think about how
you’ll describe them and what important characters might be
encountered in each place.
Characters: Who will the PCs meet during this adventure? Plan
for the most important NPCs that are likely to be encountered.
What are those NPCs trying to achieve and what do they want?
That helps figure out how they’ll act and react to what the PCs
do or say (check out the ‘NPCs’ section).
Enemies: Which NPCs are potentially hostile to the PCs? This
indicates when Combat Encounters are likely to happen. You’ll
also want to prepare characteristics (‘statblocks’) for enemies
so that you know how many dice they roll based on their Stats,
what Signature Attacks and Qualities they have, etc. You may
also want to think about what the Kids might be faced with
while the Animon are fighting. Sometimes they will simply be
cheering on from the sidelines, while other times they might
have to deal with other problems or challenges themselves.

101

Planning a Campaign
When you play through multiple adventures with the same characters,
they have more chances to Level Up, develop and grow in many ways.
Campaigns in tabletop RPGs are longer, interconnected series of
adventures that tell the story of the PCs as they overcome many trials
and challenges, just like how episodes of a TV series can link together
to tell a longer tale.
Early on in a Campaign, you’ll want to include these key story points,
although which order they happen in is up to you:

•
•
•

Introduce the Kids: Each Player should have an opportunity
to describe and introduce their Kid character to the rest of the
group, and explore how exactly they get involved in the story.
Introduce the Animon: Of course, before long the Kids should
meet their Animon! The first meeting is an important moment
in the story, so try to make it memorable and make sure to give
enough time for the partners to interact.
Introduce the Ani-Tools: This might happen before or after the
partners come together, but at some point they’ll receive their
Ani-Tools and get a vague idea of what they can do, as well as
how they’re related to the bond between Kid and Animon.

Often throughout these adventures, particular elements will tie the
overarching story together; for example, there might be a mastermind
villain who has secretly been coordinating all the bad guys, or there
may be a deep mystery that can’t be solved at the start of the story,
which results in a massive revelation later on. As the GM, you can
think about what might link your group’s adventures together. Just as
with planning for adventures, there are lots of things that can change
in the story depending on what the PCs do but, if you make your
plans flexible, you will often find they can be adapted to fit the new
direction of the story.
In a campaign, PCs have more opportunities to Level Up by earning
XP. They will also naturally gain more Bond Strain and over time the
likelihood of Bond Break Episodes will increase. As the GM, you
should think about how those Bond Break Episodes might play out
based on the characters that will be involved, and how the Player

102

imagines their characters developing. All Animon stories are about
growing up, learning, and evolving. These things will naturally
happen as you play the game, so keep an eye out for opportunities to
create meaningful character moments and tie them into the current
adventure, as well as the wider campaign story.

Example Setting & Campaign: DIGITAL ECHOES

There is a whole world within cyberspace, a shadow of the physical
world’s information networks. This Cyber World is completely
unknown to most of humanity and interactions between the two worlds
have until now consisted only of strange data distortions and random
power fluctuations.
For some reason, ‘tunnels’ between the worlds have begun to open in
certain places. When this happens, an invisible barrier begins to expand
throughout the area, inside which the physical world undergoes a
conversion into digital data. These zones, known as Digital Echoes,
can be dangerous if they grow large enough. Eventually they gain
enough power to absorb people — children are the most susceptible, so
the first sign of a large Digital Echo is the disappearance of children in
the local area.
The Kid characters find themselves sucked into a Digital Echo, where
they meet their Animon partners for the first time and find Ani-Tools.
These allow the PCs to locate and enter any new Digital Echoes that
show up. Together, they must enter each Digital Echo, rescue whoever
has been trapped inside, and find a way to shut them down. This usually
involves defeating the ‘controllers,’ Animon that have somehow been
programmed to transmit data. They control the expansion of the Digital
Echoes and the conversion of the physical world into digital form.

103

These controllers can also corrupt other Animon and make them follow
their orders. When they’re defeated, the Digital Echo they control will
collapse and the physical world will return to normal. Strangely,
someone could spend a whole day inside a Digital Echo and, when it
collapses, only a few minutes will have passed in the world outside!
The mystery of who or what is sending out the controllers to create
Digital Echoes is not an easily solved one. What’s certain is that the
Echoes can be big trouble if they aren’t shut down quickly, and the
PCs seem to be the only ones who can deal with them.

Example Setting & Campaign: PARADISE LOST

Everyone knows a fairy story or two from when they were kids. Magical
creatures, strange happenings, supernatural mysteries, these things are
commonly found in folktales and nursery rhymes. What most people
don’t know is that they’re all true — or at least based on the truth. The
Otherworld is a place where magic, mystery, and monsters are all very
real. Perhaps it’s another dimension or a parallel world. Very rarely,
gateways open up between the human world and the Otherworld and,
in some cases, fey monsters called Animon come through. Encounters
with Animon are the basis for almost every fairy story in existence,
though very few people know it!
The Kid characters are out in the countryside for one reason or another,
perhaps on a camping holiday at the same campsite, when they all
suddenly find themselves transported to the Otherworld. Waiting for
them are Animon partners of their own, but they can find no way to
get back to the human world! The Kids must work with each other and
their new partners to figure out where they are and try to find a way
back home.
Whilst they journey around the Otherworld, the PCs meet plenty of
Animon in need of help. They soon learn that a terrible and dark power,
known as the Unseelie Court, has been covering the land in shadow.
The rulers of the Unseelie Court don’t just want to take over the
Otherworld, though; eventually it’s revealed that they plan to find a way
into the human world and create a dark empire that spans both worlds.
Whether they can find a way home themselves or not, if the Kids don’t
figure out a way to stop the Unseelie Court, there won’t be any home to
go back to!

104

Example Setting & Campaign: MONSTERS INSIDE

When the Kids joined the ‘Student Self-Help Club’ at West Metro High
School, they expected it to be just a bit of fun. The club was renowned
for its lack of any real oversight or direction. Among the students who
knew about it, the club meetups were just an excuse to sit around and
let the lazy after-school hours drift by.
At least, that was true until all the club members received an unmarked
package containing strange devices called Ani-Tools. As soon as they
touched the devices, monsters called Animon appeared! Each Kid felt a
kind of deep connection with their partner Animon, as if they were
somehow two parts of the same whole.
It turns out every human being has an Animon companion, even if
they don’t know it. They mostly stay hidden, dormant inside the soul
— but sometimes particular emotional triggers can awaken them! This
can cause terrible upset inside the human’s soul and, in the worst case,
the human and Animon might switch places; the human trapped in a
closed world inside their own soul and the Animon left to wander the
physical world. Recently more and more of the teenagers at school have
been getting into these sorts of problems. Somehow the Ani-Tools
allow the PCs’ Animon to manifest alongside the Kids, and also let
them see the Animon of other people. Using the Ani-Tools, the PCs can
jump inside the ‘Soul Worlds’ of other
people and defeat their inner Animon
when they get out of control. When
these out of control Animon are
defeated, they return as eggs and
hatch into more peaceful Animon.
Somewhere along the way, they might
be able to figure out who exactly left
the Ani-Tools with them, and why.
However this mess got started, the
PCs are the only ones who can do
anything about it, so it’s the Student
Self-Help Club to the rescue!

NON-player
Characters
(NPCS)

109

Friends

and Foes
The GM is in control of all characters other than the Player Characters,
collectively referred to as Non-Player Characters (NPCs). This will
involve deciding what they do, how they react to what the PCs do, and
what they say in conversation. NPCs can be helpful to the PCs, or they
can be a hindrance — they also include bad guys and villains!

Motivation and Personality
The most important feature of an NPC is their motivation; what
each NPC wants and how they intend to achieve it helps inform
everything they do and say. This can be anything from ‘they want to
study hard and pass their exams’ for a classmate of the Kid characters,
to ‘they want to take over the world’ for the ultimate villain of the
story. Whenever you’re planning an NPC that will appear in the game,
have a think about what their motivation is — it doesn’t need to be
something incredibly world-changing or dramatic, but everyone has
at least one goal or ambition they’re working towards!
Secondly, think about the personality of the NPC. This will help
you roleplay that character in a distinctive way. Thinking of even one
personality trait that defines the NPC is a very useful way of making
characters memorable and interesting to interact with. Here is a list of
example personality traits:

•

110

Adventurous, Airy, Brave, Calm, Careful, Caring, Charming,
Cheerful, Cold, Confident, Determined, Dignified, Dramatic,
Elegant, Energetic, Fickle, Formal, Gentle, Gloomy, Gracious,
Haughty, Honest, Impatient, Impulsive, Insecure, Kind, Lazy,
Logical, Lovable, Mature, Modest, Open, Optimistic, Patient,
Pessimistic, Playful, Proud, Relaxed, Rustic, Scholarly, Sensitive,
Shrewd, Solemn, Stoic, Sympathetic, Whimsical, Wise, Witty

NPC Characteristics
Sometimes you’ll need to know certain characteristics of an NPC in
order to make dice rolls for them. The most common time when you’ll
do this is during Combat Encounters. Most Combat Encounters will be
fights between PC Animon and NPC Animon. In these encounters, the
GM will control what the NPCs do, how they fight, and make dice rolls
for them when they attack or defend. Note that it’s not always necessary
to know all the characteristics of a particular NPC, especially if they are
unlikely to be involved in a Combat Encounter.
NPCs don’t have the same Traits, Stats, and other characteristics as
PCs. Instead they have a streamlined ‘statblock’ that contains all the
information needed to determine their dice pools and control them,
especially in Combat Encounters. You can quickly create new NPC
statblocks by filling in the necessary details, which are described here:

•

Level: NPCs have a Level between 1 and 10, which broadly
represents how powerful they are and is roughly equivalent to
PC Bond Level. Level is used to calculate HP and Damage.

•

Skill Score: NPCs all have a Skill Score, which is equal to
1 + half their Level rounded up. If an NPC needs to attempt a
Test or make an Attack roll, they always add a number of dice
to the pool equal to their Skill Score (instead of using specific
Traits or Stats). Skill Score is also used to calculate Initiative
and Dodge.

•

Type: All NPCs are classified as one of three types: Human,
Animon, or Other. Humans and Animon have different
statblocks, as Animon have more detailed combat statistics.
The ‘Other’ type is used for any NPCs that don’t fit into the
other types, such as robots or animals.

•

HP/Stamina: Human NPCs have Stamina equal to 5 x Level.
Animon NPCs have HP equal to 6 + (6 x Level). If an NPC
reaches 0 Stamina or 0HP, they are taken out of the fight, as
described in the ‘Damage’ section.

111

112

•

Strengths: All NPCs can have Strengths, which are
equivalent to PC Kids’ Talents and PC Animons’ Qualities.
Much like Talents and Qualities, an NPC’s Strengths describe
the things they are particularly good at, or the innate features
that give them some advantage. They always have a Rank
between 1 and 3, which determines how many dice are added to
the pool when they’re used. Strengths can add dice to any roll,
including Tests, Attack rolls, and Dodge rolls. Generally, NPCs
can have up to a number of Strength Ranks equal to their Level,
spread across as many Strengths as is appropriate.

•

Weaknesses: NPC Weaknesses are equivalent to PC Kids’
Flaws, but any type of NPC can have them, not just Humans.
When a Weakness would be a disadvantage for an NPC, they
roll with Setback; while if a Weakness could be exploited by a
PC in some way, it grants Boost on any rolls to do so (e.g. an
NPC with the Cowardly Weakness would have Setback on rolls
to face their fears, while any PC that tried to scare the Cowardly
NPC would roll with Boost).

•

Stage: Animon NPCs have a Stage, much like PC Animon.
Unlike PCs, NPC Animon can remain at Stages higher than
BASIC for as long as they like, as long as it’s appropriate in the
story. Often ‘wild’ Animon permanently remain at higher Stages
once they’re reached, unless defeated and forced to Devolve.

•

Upgrades: Animon NPCs have Upgrades, which are bonuses to
their characteristics. There are four Upgrades, each of which
improve a different characteristic; the same Upgrade can be
applied multiple times. They are noted with a number indicating
how many times each Upgrade has been applied.
The four Upgrades are as follows:
› Aggressive: The NPC has +2 Damage.
› Defensive: The NPC has +1 Dodge.
› Tough: The NPC has +10HP.
› Swift: The NPC has +1 Initiative.
The number of Upgrades an Animon NPC can have is based on
their Stage:
› FLEDGLING Stage NPCs have 0 Upgrades.
› BASIC Stage NPCs can have 1 Upgrade.
› SUPER Stage NPCs can have 2 Upgrades.
› ULTRA Stage NPCs can have 3 Upgrades.
› GIGA Stage NPCs can have 4 Upgrades.

•

Classification: Animon NPCs have one Classification chosen
from the same list as PC Animon. Much like PCs, if an NPC’s
Classification would be advantageous for attempting a Test, it
grants Boost on their roll. The Classifications are as follows:
› Dragon, Beast, Avian, Insect, Plant, Aquatic, Celestial,
Infernal, Machine, Fairy, Nightmare, Unknown.

•

Element: Animon NPCs have an attunement to one of the ten
Elements, much in the same way as PC Animon. This Element
can apply Setback or Boost to Attack rolls depending on the
matchup between the attacker and defender, as explained in
the ‘Attacking and Defending’ section. The Elements are as
follows:
› Fire, Water, Nature, Electric, Earth, Wind, Light, Dark,
Mirage, Neutral.

•

Initiative: All NPCs have an Initiative score that determines
their dice pool for Initiative rolls when Combat Encounters
start. An NPC’s Initiative score is equal to their Skill Score, but
this can be modified by Upgrades.

113

•

Damage: Animon NPCs each have a Damage score, which
determines the standard amount of Damage dealt when they
successfully attack. An Animon NPC’s Damage score is
calculated based on Stage as shown:
› Damage for FLEDGLING Stage NPCs is equal to Level.
› Damage for BASIC Stage NPCs is equal to 1 + Level.
› Damage for SUPER Stage NPCs is equal to 2 + Level.
› Damage for ULTRA Stage NPCs is equal to 3 + Level.
› Damage for GIGA Stage NPCs is equal to 4 + Level.
Human NPCs are all treated as if they have a Damage score of 1,
unless otherwise stated.

114

•

Dodge: Animon NPCs have a Dodge score, which determines
their dice pool for Dodge rolls. An NPC’s Dodge score is equal
to their Skill Score, but this can be modified by Upgrades.

•

Signature Attack: Animon NPCs have a Signature Attack. This
will have a Name, an Element, and a Rank (the number of dice
added to Attack rolls when the ability is used). NPC Signature
Attacks don’t have Effects. Generally, NPCs of Levels 1-3 have a
Signature Attack Rank of 1, Levels 4-6 have a Rank of 2, Levels
7-9 have a Rank of 3, and Level 10s have a Rank of 4, though
this should be altered based on how dangerous an NPC
Animon is intended to be.
› Uses: Unlike PCs, Animon NPCs can use their Signature
Attacks an unlimited number of times.

•

Special: NPCs can have various features and abilities that
don’t fit into the game in the same way as PC characteristics.
The ‘Special’ section of an NPC statblock describes anything
that NPC can do which has not already been stated, including
unique features of their Signature Attacks, Conditions they can
choose to inflict a certain number of times per Combat
Encounter, and other offensive, defensive, or utility abilities
they have. There are no rules covering exactly what kinds of
special characteristics NPCs can have but, generally more
powerful abilities should be reserved for high-level NPCs. Take
a look through the Example NPCs to find some examples of
special features, but always feel free to create your own.

Ready-to-use

Example NPCS
In this section you will find various example NPCs, both Human and
Animon, that can be used in your own games. You should also use
these as a source of inspiration when creating your own NPCs
— especially Animon! Creating unique Animon NPCs to appear
in your stories is a great thing to do, as they can challenge the PCs
in particular and interesting ways. The names of Animon NPCs are
intentionally left up to each group to decide.

The Game
Due to the many inspirations that can be drawn for Animon Story,
from anime, video games, and beyond, there may be a specific way you
want to play that isn’t reflected in the main rules. This Optional Rules
Suite is here to offer rules modules, small packages of changes,
suggestions, mechanics etc. that can alter the feel of your Animon Story
campaign, whilst still keeping the core system in-tact.
Note from the author:
These are called ‘optional’ for a reason. The most common reason is that
these rules felt too complicated or granular to be in the main rulebook.
There are also rules modules that significantly change the tone of the
game, shifting the focus away from the bond between two partners.
If it’s your first time playing Animon Story, I highly recommend
sticking to the main rules for now. Once you’re comfortable with the
system, browse through and see which rules modules might enhance your
experience! Try not to use too many at once though, as that can end up
being more confusing than it’s worth.

166

1. Animon Teams & Catching
You might want to play as Kid characters who go around capturing
multiple animon and forming a team. This changes the core focus
of Animon Story, as the story will no longer revolve around just one
Animon partner, and the relationship they have with a Kid.
Applying this rules module requires several basic alterations to the
core rules, and the addition of a capture mechanic. Here are several
key changes to apply:

•

Ignore FLEDGLING and GIGA Stages for all animon. With
these rules, animon start at BASIC Stage and can Evolve as far
as ULTRA Stage.

•

Each Kid may have up to 3 animon in their active party. This
cap may be increased to 6 when PCs reach Level 5.

•

PCs have access to a ranch, or other storage system where they
can keep animon outside of the active party. Animon kept in
this storage system are safe, happy, and comfortable.

•

Bond Level now represents the bond between a Kid and their
whole team of animon. It remains a single score. Bond Level
increases, Score Improvements, and Upgrades are applied to all
captured animon individually, at the same time.

•

Newly captured animon are considered the same Bond Level,
and have the same number of Upgrades etc. as all currently
captured animon.

•

Each PC may have only 1 animon participating in Combat at
one time, in most situations. PCs can switch out active party
animon as an action.

Using these rules there are two different ways that Kid characters can
capture new animon and add them to their team. The first is via a
Capture Test, usually made during a Combat Encounter. The second
is by means of a Join The Party Episode, a narrative sequence of
events that results in an animon voluntarily joining the team.

167

Capture Tests

When a Kid character wants to add a particular animon to their team,
they can challenge them to battle and attempt a Capture Test. When
an animon is captured this way, they see the Kid as a worthy partner,
and will happily join the team.
When a PC attempts a Capture Test, the Difficulty Rating and other
modifiers must first be decided. The default Difficulty is based on the
current Stage of the animon:
• 3 for BASIC Stage animon
• 4 for SUPER Stage animon
• 5 for ULTRA Stage animon
Next, Setback/Boost is applied. If the animon has over half their
max. HP, the Capture Test is made with Setback. If the animon was
reduced to under a quarter of their max. HP, the Test roll has Boost.
The Capture Test must be made using the Kid’s Traits, and relevant
Talents. The GM decides, based on the Stats and Nature of the
animon, whether that animon wants a Wise partner, a Strong
partner, or a Kind partner most. Depending on the answer, Brains,
Reflex, or Spirit must be used in the Capture Test, respectively.
If the Capture Test is successful, the animon is captured and becomes
part of the team. They should be given PC stats, and Levelled Up to
the same point as the other animon on the team.

Join The Party Episodes

Sometimes Kid characters gain a new team member through the
story, rather than through battle and capture. Much like with Bond
Break Episodes, this should be discussed ahead of time between the
Player and GM.
Throughout the course of the Join The Party Episode, the Kid PC and
the animon in question should establish a bond, whether through
helping one another, or realising they have shared goals, or other
things in common.
Join The Party Episodes should include an obstacle, threat, or other
problem that must be overcome before the new animon can join the
team properly. After that, the Kid and new animon become partners.

168

2. Fusion Evolution
Fusion Evolution occurs when two characters merge together, joining
forces and merging their powers. Fusion Evolution requires unlocking
through the story, just like normal Evolution, and follows all the usual
rules and restrictions as well. There are two types of Fusion:

Animon + Animon Fusion

This type of Fusion Evolution involves two animon Evolving together
into a shared form. When creating and using this type of Fusion
Evolution, use the normal rules, and apply these changes:

•

Fusion Evolution costs one Bond Point from each PC involved.

•

The Evolved Animon gets two actions per round.

•

The animon gets two Signature Attacks.

•

The animon benefits from the Score Improvements of both
fused animon.

•

The animon gains a new Quality at Rank 2, or two new
Qualities and Rank 1 each. They also have access to the
Qualities of all lower Stages of both fused animon.

•

The fused animon separate during Devolution, and follow the
same Devolution rules relating to damage taken.

Kid + Animon Fusion

This type of Fusion involves a Kid and Animon partner fusing into
one being. This could be the standard form of Evolution in your game.
If so, it can be thematic, with no need for special rules.
Otherwise, it can be a special Evolution only used at the GIGA Stage.
In this case, the fused PCs act as one character in Combat Encounters,
and can use both Kid and Animon features (Talents, Qualities etc.).
The Evolved animon also gains a bonus based on the highest Trait of
the Kid character:
• If Logic, gain +1 Dodge and +1 Initiative
• If Reflex, gain +4 Damage
• If Spirit, gain +10HP

169

3. Transformations
Using these rules, Kid characters have the power to transform into
animon. Rather than being independant, the Kid and the Animon are
more like independant personalities that share the same form. How
this happens is up to you and your group of Players. You may wish
for the Animon partner to still appear independant in a FLEDGLING
Stage form, only to fuse with the Kid when Evolving. Instead, you
might have the Animon side come out only through Evolution, like a
power hidden inside the Kid characters.
One variation on this is for the animon powers to manifest as a magic
weapon or armour that the Kid character can equip and use. They
might even be sentient weapons! The Stats of the animon remain the
same, but are treated as active only when equipped by the Kid. For example, a Kid enters battle and summons their ‘animon weapon’. In the
Combat Encounter, the HP, Stats, Signature Attack, and everything
else from the animon section of the character sheet are used as per
usual. If HP is reduced to 0, the weapon would ‘power down.’

4. Side Evolutions
Using these rules allows Animon characters to have multiple
Evolutions at the same Stage, which they can choose between when
Evolving. These Side Evolutions should be unlocked and tracked the
same way as normal Evolved forms. When Levelling Up or gaining
Improvements/Upgrades, apply these changes to all Evolutions of the
same Stage at once. Evolving to any of these forms counts towards the
De/Re-Evolution restrictions as usual.

Burst Evolution

This is a special type of Evolution that is more powerful than BASIC
Stage, but weaker than SUPER Stage. BURST form animon are
treated as BASIC, but gain either +5HP, +2 Damage, +1 Dodge, or +1
Initiative and Sig. Attack Uses, Player choice. Also, the Ranks of
their Signature Attack and Qualities are temporarily increased by 1.
Burst Evolution is taxing. Every round the Animon is in BURST form,
the Kid loses 1 Stamina. If reduced to 0, the PC gains Harm as usual.

170

5. Animon Trading Card Game
Trading cards are a staple of the monster-taming genre. These rules
allow PCs in an Animon Story campaign to collect and battle with
trading cards. This is intended to be a mini-game that the PCs can
engage with alongside the actual story.
Warning: this rules module invovles quite a lot of note-taking and
tracking, as Players will need to record each trading card they gain. If
you want the same flavour without as much work, simply reward the
PCs with animon trading cards as items, without worrying about any
specific mechanics.
Throughout the game, PCs can find, earn, or otherwise gain Animon
Cards, each based on a different animon. It might be fun if these cards
feature animon that the PCs have encountered in the story so far.
Players should keep a list of all the cards they gain, perhaps on the
back of their character sheet. This is called their Collection.
Animon Cards each have three features that should be noted: Name,
Element, and Level. Name and Element should be the same as the
animon the card is based on. Level is different — the Level of the card
is determined by the Evolutionary Stage of the animon:
• FLEDGLING Stage = Level 0
• BASIC Stage = Level 1
• SUPER Stage = Level 2
• ULTRA Stage = Level 3
• GIGA Stage = Level 4
Card listings can be made using the following simple format:
• Leafpig, Nature, Level 0.
• Cerberurn, Fire, Level 4.
There’s no limit to the number of cards a PC can have in their card
Collection. Once the Collection has at least 5 cards in it, that PC can
challenge other PCs, or NPCs, to an Animon Card Battle.
Animon Card Battling makes use of a simple dice-based minigame. It
could be used as part of the story — NPCs might offer rewards to PCs
who can beat them.

171

Animon Card Battles

Animon Card Battles take place either between two PCs, or a PC and
an NPC. When an Animon Card Battle is declared, participants must
quickly select 5 cards from their Collection to form a Battle Deck. If
an NPC is taking part, the GM should determine an appropriately
challenging Battle Deck for them to use. In a pinch, use animon from
the NPC section of this book to make cards. The Battle Deck cannot
be changed once the Battle has begun.
Animon Card Battles take place over multiple rounds, in which both
participants select cards from their Battle Deck to send into the fight.
The structure is as follows:
1. Players each secretly choose 1 card from their Battle Deck to
fight with.
2. Players simultaneously reveal which card they chose by saying
the name aloud (or typing into a text chat).
3. Players each roll 1d6+Level, using the Level of the card they
chose. The one who rolls higher wins the round. If there is a
draw, immediately re-roll until there is a winner.
If an Animon Card has an Element that is strong against their
opponent (based on the same Elemental triangles used in the
main game), that Player instead rolls 2d6 and takes the higher
result, before adding Level.
4. Players cannot choose a card if it has already been chosen
during the game, whether it won or lost the fight. The first
Player to win 3 rounds is the overall winner!
Animon Card Battles can also be played in a ‘Best of 3’ format, in
which the first Player to be the overall winner of 2 Animon Card
Battles wins the contest.
In certain battles, particularly intense ones, it may be the case that the
loser must reward the winner with a card from their Collection. This
isn’t always the case though, as plenty of people simply like to collect
the cards and play for fun.

172

6. Power-Ups
Using these rules, Kid characters have access to special Ani-tool
abilities that can help Power-Up their Animon partners. As the GM,
you can reward Players with new unlockable Power-Ups throughout
the story. They should be listed alongside other Ani-tool functions.
Power-Ups can be used in Combat Encounters as an action taken by
the Kids, so it doesn’t take the Animon character’s action. Each
Power-Up has an effect that lasts until the start of the animon’s next
turn, unless otherwise stated. Here is a list of example Power-Ups:

•

Element Change: The animon and animon’s Signature Attack
becomes a different Element (the Element is determined when
the Power-Up is unlocked).

•

HP Boost: The animon gains 10 max. and current HP.

•

Damage Boost: The animon gains +2 Damage.

•

Dodge Boost: The animon gains +1 Dodge.

•

Signature Burst: The animon gains an entirely new Signature
Attack that can be used this turn. (Name, Effects, and Element
are determined when the Power-Up is unlocked, Rank is the
same as the animon’s current Signature Attack Rank).

•

Quality Burst: The animon gains an entirely new Quality.

7. Permanent Evolution
You may want your setting to feature animon who don’t Devolve, but
instead change their permanent form. This is a fairly simple change
in terms of mechanics, but be aware that the PCs will become more
powerful than when playing by normal rules. Make these changes:

•

Ignore all rules relating to Devolution.

•

Ignore Boost/Setback on attacks based on the difference
between the attacker and defender’s Stage.

ANIMON STORY Quick Reference
TESTS p.067
Players roll dice to determine if their characters succeed or fail to achieve things. This is called a Test.
1. Assemble a dice pool with Kid Traits + Talents or Animon Stats + Qualities + Sig. Attack.
2. GM announces Difficulty Rating, a number typically between 1 and 5 (standard = 2).
3. Player rolls dice and counts the number of ‘successes.’ On a standard roll, each dice showing a
result of 4+ counts as a success, but this can be changed by Setback and Boost.
If a roll has Setback, only dice results of 5+ count as successes. If a roll has Boost, results of 3+ count.
Players can improve their chances before rolling by spending Bond Points, or after failing by Pushing
the roll, allowing them to re-roll all the dice and take the new result. They also gain 1 Bond Strain.
COMBAT ENCOUNTERS p.070
When a fight breaks out, use the following
steps to resolve a Combat Encounter:

ATTACKING & DEFENDING p.071-075
When a PC Animon attacks, they assemble a dice pool
using Stat + Sig. Attack (if used) + Quality (if used).

1. Roll Initiative to determine the order
characters will take turns. PCs always
win ties on Initiative rolls.

•

Use Power to attack when the target is close and there is a clear
shot, such as when fighting at very short range, or when there’s
an opening in the target’s defences.

2. Track the Critical Gauge from the
Initiative roll onward. For each 6 a PC
rolls, 1 point is added to the Gauge.

•

Use Heart to attack when you purposefully put yourself in
harm’s way or when the target has you on the back foot, such as
when you are overwhelmed or outnumbered.

3. Characters take turns and can make
one action per turn, such as attacking
enemies, or anything requiring a roll.

•

Use Brains to attack when you must use precision or when you
attack from a secure position, such as when the target is some
distance away from you.

4. Once the fight is over Animon
characters can ‘catch their breath’,
recovering HP equal to 1 + Heart
score. This includes any animon who
were reduced to 0HP during the
combat encounter.

•

Use Agility to attack when you move to close the distance or
keep up with the target, or when you need to attack stealthily.

CONDITIONS p.076

If the attacker rolls equal to or more than the number
of successes the defender rolled, the attack hits and
deals damage equal to the attacker’s Damage score +
the difference between the attack and defence rolls.

•

Poisoned characters take damage at the end of
their turn equal to the Power (or Skill Score) of
the poisoner until the Combat Encounter ends.

•
•

Stunned characters miss their next turn.

•
•

Weakened characters deal half damage.

•

Immobilised characters cannot move but may
still make an Action on their turn.

•

Incapacitated characters cannot move or make
Actions, and are also considered Vulnerable.

•

Boosted characters gain Boost on all their rolls
during their next turn.

Disoriented characters have Setback on any
Attack rolls they make.
Vulnerable characters have Setback on any
Dodge rolls they make.

Setback and Boost might be added due to the Element
matchup, Stage difference, or other factors (p.67-68).
When a PC Animon is attacked, they make a Defence
roll using their Dodge score and relevant Qualities.

ELEMENTAL MATCHUPS

ANIMON STORY Quick Reference
CRITICAL GAUGE p.076-077
The Critical Gauge threshold is 2 x the
number of people playing (including both
Players and the GM). Once it’s reached,
the PCs may use a Critical Move:

•

Critical Combo Attack: The Player who triggers
this Critical Move uses their action and picks
a target, then each PC Animon in the Combat
Encounter makes an Attack roll against the same
target using their Sig. Attack. The target’s Dodge
roll must be made with one Setback (ignoring
all other sources of Setback and Boost). Each
successful Attack roll deals damage as usual.

•

Critical Evolution: PC Animon may all Evolve
to their current highest Stage without spending
Bond Points or gaining Bond Strain.

•

Critical Success: A PC may automatically pass
any single Test without rolling.

•

Critical Threat: All PCs have their Bond Points
fully restored. The GM describes how a current
problem gets a lot worse or how a new unforseen
problem becomes a major threat.

REST & RECOVERY p.080-082
When PCs rest for at least a couple of uniterrupted
hours, they gain the following benefits:

•
•
•

Kids reset Stamina to half their maximum if below.
Animon regain HP equal to 1 + their Heart score.
If a Kid and their Animon partner are together while Resting,
they regain 1 lost Bond Point.

PCs may also engage in a single Rest Activity each:

•
•
•
•

Recuperate: The PCs regain all lost Stamina and HP.

•

Address Harm: The PCs attempt a Test with a Difficulty Rating
equal to 1 + Harm Severity. If successful, the Harm is removed.
Another character can make the roll for them (the helper doesn’t
have to choose this Rest Activity).

Socialise: The PCs regain 1 lost Bond Point.
De-Stress: Roll a single D6. On a 4+ the PCs lose 1 Bond Strain.
Make a Plan: The PCs plan for a specific obstacle they expect
to encounter due to prior knowledge. Attempt a Difficulty 2 Test
with Logic or Brains. If successful, gain Boost to overcome the
obstacle, as long as it’s exactly as described while planning.

BOND POINTS p.083
Bond Points are a special resource that PCs can spend to help them in various ways. A Kid’s Special
Item also grants them a free spend of 1 Bond Point when it is significant in a scene. Remember that if
Bond Strain is higher than maximum Bond Points, the characters are at risk of a Bond Break Episode!
Bond Points can be spent for the following benefits:

•
•
•

Better Odds: Spend 1 Bond Point to gain 2 dice on ANY roll. Spend 2 Bond Points to gain 3 dice, 3 Bond Points for 4, etc.

•

Fight On: Spend 3 Bond Points when a character would be reduced to 0 Stamina or 0HP. That character is instead
reduced to 1 Stamina or 1HP.

•

Lucky Break: Spend 1-3 Bond Points (based on GM discretion) to add a change to the scene or story. The cost will be
higher for changes that are improbable or extremely convenient — the GM has the final say on what is reasonable.

Dig Deep: Spend 1 Bond Point to gain an extra Use when an Animon has run out of Signature Attack Uses.
Interject: Spend 2 Bond Points to make an immediate extra action in combat (or any other circumstance where no action
would normally be possible).

EVOLUTION & DEVOLUTION p.060-062
Unless it’s the first time reaching a new Stage, an Animon Evolving to their current highest Stage
must spend 1 Bond Point; Evolving to any Stage but the current highest costs no points. Evolving does
not take an action in combat. Animon can only maintain their highest available Stage for one Scene
or Combat Encounter before Devolving again. If an Animon has Evolved to their highest available
Stage, then Devolved, and is trying to Evolve again before Resting, they must first gain 1 Bond Strain.
When an Animon is reduced to 0HP or reaches the end of a Scene or Combat Encounter as their
highest available Stage, they must Devolve according to the rules on p.055. Also note that damage
taken persists when Evolving (with the exception of the first time reaching a new Stage) - see p.056.
