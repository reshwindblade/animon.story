# Animon Creation Rules

This document outlines the comprehensive rules for creating Animon characters in Animon Story, based on the core rulebook.

## Overview

Animon are sentient, intelligent monsters that can speak human languages. When an Animon builds a strong bond of friendship with a Kid partner, they will grow in strength and eventually gain the ability to evolve into powerful (but temporary) new forms. Animon are from another world (or worlds) to our own.

All Animon are highly intelligent and most can speak and understand the languages of their partner. When they grow, especially through a bond with a Kid, they can **Evolve** into larger and more powerful forms.

## Evolution Stages

The five stages of Animon Evolution from lowest to highest are:

**FLEDGLING > BASIC > SUPER > ULTRA > GIGA**

When creating an Animon character, you determine the characteristics of the **BASIC Stage** first, as this is the Stage an Animon spends most time in. You must also create the **FLEDGLING Stage** characteristics.

## Character Creation Process

### 1. Choose Classification

All Animon can be broadly placed within one of twelve different categories called their **Classification** (abbreviated to Class on the character sheet). This is a general descriptive term that helps to give Players an understanding of what each Animon looks like and how they might act.

**Classification Benefits:**
- Grants **Boost** to any rolls made when interacting with non-hostile Animon of the same Classification
- Grants **Boost** to any rolls made to explore or navigate through their favoured environment

#### Available Classifications

- **Beast:** Often have mammalian features like fur, paws, tails, and snouts. They typically favour grasslands, forests, and other natural environments
- **Bird:** Often have avian features like feathers, wings, beaks, and talons. They typically favour aerial environments and high places like mountains and tall trees
- **Bug:** Often have insectoid features like chitinous shells, antennae, and multiple limbs. They typically favour underground environments
- **Dragon:** Often have draconic and/or dinosaur-like features like scales, horns, wings, and claws. They typically favour rocky, mountainous environments (varies based on Element)
- **Fish:** Often have aquatic features like fins, scales, and gills. They typically favour underwater environments
- **Flora:** Often have plant-like features such as leaves, bark, roots, and flowers. They typically favour environments with rich soil and plant life
- **Ghost:** Often have ethereal, translucent, or otherwise incorporeal features. They typically favour dark, spooky environments
- **Humanoid:** Often have human-like features such as upright posture, hands, and facial features. Their favoured environments vary between individuals
- **Machine:** Often have mechanical features like metal plating, gears, wires, and digital displays. They typically favour urban environments
- **Mineral:** Often have rocky or crystalline features like gems, ore, and stone. They typically favour underground environments
- **Slime:** Often have gelatinous, liquid, or otherwise amorphous features. Their favoured environments vary between individuals
- **Unknown:** Any Animon that doesn't fit into other Classifications. They might be amorphous or have otherwise unusual features. Their favoured environments vary between individuals

### 2. Choose Element

All Animon have an attunement to one of ten different **Elements**, which are sources of power drawn from different aspects of the world. This is sometimes called their **Innate Element**.

#### Available Elements

- **Fire**
- **Water** 
- **Nature**
- **Electric**
- **Earth**
- **Ice**
- **Wind**
- **Light**
- **Dark**
- **Mirage**
- **Neutral**

**In battle**, depending on the match-up between the Element of an attack and the Element of the defending Animon, the attack may be made with **Setback** or **Boost**.

### 3. Choose Nature

Animon are all very different and have unique personalities. This is represented by an Animon's **Nature**, which has both a positive and a negative side.

#### Available Natures

- **Brave** (Courageous but Reckless)
- **Calm** (Peaceful but Apathetic)
- **Cheerful** (Upbeat but Naive)
- **Clever** (Intelligent but Scheming)
- **Cool** (Collected but Aloof)
- **Curious** (Inquisitive but Nosy)
- **Fierce** (Determined but Aggressive)
- **Gentle** (Kind but Weak-willed)
- **Lively** (Energetic but Restless)
- **Obedient** (Attentive but Dependant)

**Note:** The Nature grants no particular mechanical bonus. Instead, it is a useful tool for determining how that character will speak and act in the story. It's recommended that a Kid and their Animon have different, perhaps even opposing natures, so that their relationship is dynamic and interesting.

### 4. Determine Stats

Animon characters have four **Stats** that are equivalent to the Kid characters' Traits. They are used to create dice pools when the Animon is attempting a Test or attacking. They also help determine the HP, Dodge, Damage, and Initiative scores of the Animon.

#### The Four Stats

**Power**
- A measure of the strength and raw energy flowing through an Animon
- The ability to transform that energy into powerful attacks
- Determines the **Damage** score

**Heart** 
- The vitality and endurance of an Animon
- Their moxie and strength of spirit
- Determines the **HP** score

**Brains**
- How quick witted, perceptive, and knowledgeable an Animon is
- Determines the **Initiative** score
- Determines the number of times the Animon can use their Signature Attacks in battle

**Agility**
- How swift and dexterous an Animon is
- How quick their reflexes are
- Determines the **Dodge** score

#### Stat Distribution

**For BASIC Stage:**
- All Stats start at a base of **1**
- Distribute **8 points** between them as you see fit
- Cannot raise a Stat higher than **4** at BASIC Stage

**For FLEDGLING Stage:**
- All Stats start at a base of **1** 
- Distribute **4 points** between them as you see fit
- Cannot raise a Stat higher than **3** at FLEDGLING Stage
- The distribution doesn't necessarily have to match the BASIC Stage

### 5. Set HP, Damage, Dodge, and Initiative

These four important derived statistics are calculated from the Animon's Stats:

#### HP (Hit Points)
Represents how much damage an Animon can take before being knocked out.
- **BASIC Stage:** 5 + (3 × Heart)
- **FLEDGLING Stage:** 3 × Heart

#### Damage  
Represents the destructive power of an Animon's attacks.
- **BASIC Stage:** 2 × Power
- **FLEDGLING Stage:** Power

#### Dodge
Represents how well an Animon can avoid or parry incoming attacks.
- **All Stages:** Equal to Agility

#### Initiative
Represents how quickly an Animon is able to react.
- **All Stages:** Equal to Brains

### 6. Create Signature Attack

Every single Animon of BASIC Stage or higher has a **Signature Attack** that is unique to them. This takes the form of a special move with its own Name, Element, and Effect.

#### Signature Attack Components

**Name**
- All Signature Attacks have names
- Pick something fitting and descriptive
- Examples: Lightning Breath, Spore Surprise, Aero Strike, Solar Beam, Lunar Blaster

**Uses**
- Each Animon can only use their Signature Attack a certain number of times in a single Combat Encounter
- Number of Uses = Animon's **Brains** score
- Animon who have run out of Uses may spend a **Bond Point** to get an extra use
- All Uses are restored when they catch their breath after the Combat Encounter

**Element**
- Signature Attacks have an affinity to a particular Element (Attack Element)
- Often the same Element as the Animon, but can be different
- **Exception:** Neutral Element Animon must have Neutral Element attacks

**Effect**
Choose from the following effects or work with GM to create custom effects:
- **Accurate:** Attack is made with Boost
- **Area:** Attack hits multiple targets
- **Brutal:** Attack deals +1 Damage
- **Defensive:** Grants +1 Dodge until next turn
- **Draining:** Restores 1 HP when attack hits
- **Empowering:** Grants +1 to all Stats until next turn
- **Hindering:** Target gets -1 to all Stats until next turn
- **Piercing:** Ignores 1 point of Dodge
- **Reliable:** Minimum 1 success guaranteed
- **Stunning:** Target loses their next action if hit

**Rank**
- Signature Attacks start at **Rank 1**
- Rank = number of dice added to pool when using the attack
- Can be increased through character advancement

### 7. Choose a Quality

**Qualities** are advantageous characteristics that help define what makes each Animon special and unique. Each Quality has a **Rank** that represents how significant the advantage is.

Choose one Quality at **Rank 1** for your Animon. Example Qualities include:
- Combat abilities
- Social advantages  
- Environmental adaptations
- Special senses or capabilities
- Unique physical traits

Each Animon Stage can have up to **2 Qualities**, which apply at that Stage and all higher Stages.

### 8. Choose a Name

Choose an appropriate name for your Animon that fits their personality, appearance, or abilities.

### 9. Finish FLEDGLING Stage

Complete the FLEDGLING Stage characteristics using the reduced stat distribution and derived statistics as outlined above.

## Testing and Dice Mechanics

When an Animon character attempts a Test or attacks, this is usually calculated as:

**Stat + Quality (+ Signature Attack if applicable)**

- Each die showing **4+** counts as a success under normal circumstances
- With **Boost**: dice results of **3+** count as successes  
- With **Setback**: only dice results of **5+** count as successes

## Evolution System

### Evolution Requirements
- **SUPER Stage:** Bond Level 3
- **ULTRA Stage:** Bond Level 6  
- **GIGA Stage:** Bond Level 9
- GM may add additional requirements (items, Ani-Tool upgrades, etc.)

### Evolution Triggers
Animon evolve "When the Need is Great" - typically when the Animon's abilities are needed to protect their partner or accomplish something critical.

### Evolution Costs
- **First time reaching a new Stage:** HP restored to maximum, no cost
- **Subsequent evolutions to current highest Stage:** Costs 1 Bond Point, HP not reset
- **Evolving to lower Stages:** No cost

### Evolution Duration
- Can only remain in highest available Stage for **one Combat Encounter or Scene**
- Must then Devolve back to a lower Stage
- Attempting to Evolve again without resting first causes **1 Bond Strain**

### Devolution Rules
- Animon can willingly return to a lower Stage at any time
- May be forced to Devolve if reduced to 0 HP or become too tired/hungry
- After reaching a new Stage for the first time, must Devolve to FLEDGLING and rest before returning to BASIC
- When Devolving from highest Stage, roll Heart Test (Difficulty 2):
  - **Pass:** Devolve to BASIC Stage
  - **Fail:** Devolve to FLEDGLING Stage

## Creating Evolved Stages

When unlocking new Evolution Stages, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Classification and Element** (may change from earlier Stages)
2. **Determine Stats** (distribute 2 extra points beyond previous Stage limits)
3. **Set HP, Damage, Dodge, and Initiative** (use new formulas for higher Stages)
4. **Choose new Signature Attack** (can use earlier Stage attacks plus new one)
5. **Choose a new Quality** (gain new Rank 1 Quality)
6. **Choose a Name** (may change when Evolved)

Higher Stage derived statistics:
- **SUPER Stage:** HP = 8 + (4 × Heart), Damage = 3 × Power
- **ULTRA Stage:** HP = 12 + (5 × Heart), Damage = 4 × Power  
- **GIGA Stage:** HP = 16 + (6 × Heart), Damage = 5 × Power
