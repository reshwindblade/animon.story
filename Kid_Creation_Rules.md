# Kid Creation Rules

This document outlines the comprehensive rules for creating Kid characters in Animon Story, based on the core rulebook.

## Overview

The main characters of any Animon Story are the Kids and their partner Animon. While the GM sometimes takes on the role of a character's Animon, the actions and moods of a Kid are always firmly in the control of the Player. The Kid is the character that a Player truly inhabits in the story.

**Important:** It's best for all Players to create their characters at the same time, in a group. This way you can ensure there's not too much overlap and discuss the relationships between the characters as they are created.

## Character Creation Process

### 1. Choose Kid Type

Each Kid has a Type, which serves as a broad description of the character. **In your group, each PC should be of a different Kid Type.**

Available Kid Types:
- Bookworm
- Computer Wizard  
- Delinquent
- Free Spirit
- Gamer
- Gentle Heart
- Grown-Up
- Jock
- Little Kid
- Loner
- Rising Star
- Wild Child
- Young Aristocrat

#### Type Features

Each Kid Type has a special Type Feature that represents something that Type is specialized in. In all cases, the Type Feature presents situations in which characters of that Type gain **Boost** on their rolls. This is usually applied to rolls using Kid's Traits, but if the GM decides it's relevant, the same bonus can be applied to rolls using Animon Stats.

#### Special Item

A Kid's Special Item is something they'll rarely, if ever, be seen without. It might be a handy tool, a prize possession, or something of personal significance. When a PC's item plays a significant role in the story, they gain the effects of spending a Bond Point for free.

When choosing a Special Item, also decide how the Kid got it â€” was it a birthday present from a loved one, a purchase they saved up for themselves, or something else? A Special Item cannot be permanently lost, unless the Player and GM agree this would be dramatically appropriate.

### 2. Choose Traits

Kid characters have three Traits that are each assigned a numerical score. Traits partly represent the physical, mental, and social abilities of a Kid, while also representing the approach to problem-solving favoured by each Kid.

#### The Three Traits

**Body**
- This Trait is best applied to physically demanding tasks and those that rely on raw physical power or endurance
- Kids with high Body scores are typically athletic and physically robust
- Body would be used for Tests related to climbing, lifting, running, and enduring physical hardship

**Mind**
- This Trait is best applied to mentally challenging tasks and those that require study, reasoning, or memory
- Kids with high Mind scores are typically intelligent and knowledgeable
- Mind would be used for Tests related to recalling information, solving puzzles, academic subjects, and making logical deductions

**Spirit**
- This Trait is best applied to bolstering determination and using strength of character to persuade or influence others
- Kids with high Spirit scores are typically confident and resolute
- Spirit would be used for Tests related to facing fears, forging ahead despite setbacks, and inspiring or convincing others

#### Trait Scores

When creating your Kid character, distribute scores of **4, 3, and 2** between the three Traits as you see fit. This gives each Kid a stronger Trait, an average Trait, and a weaker Trait. Note that these remain the same throughout the game - they do not increase like other character attributes.

### 3. Choose Talents

Talents are specific things that characters are good at. Talents can be related to:
- Academic knowledge (Biology, Chemistry, Geography, etc.)
- Physical strengths (Long Jump, Sprinting, Climbing, etc.)
- Social skills (Small Talk, Persuasion, Deception, etc.)
- Creative skills (Drawing, Writing, Music, etc.)
- Or more descriptive terms such as a belief or disposition (The Grown-up One, Graceful, Quiet Confidence, Insatiable Curiosity, etc.)

#### Talent Rules

- Talents have a **Rank**, which is the number of dice they add to pools when that Talent is useful
- All Talents start at **Rank 1**
- Characters can increase their Talent Ranks (up to a maximum of **Rank 3**) and even gain new Talents throughout the game
- Each Kid character starts with **2 Talents** at Rank 1

### 4. Choose a Flaw

A Flaw is anything that has a chance to create a disadvantage for a character. They are as diverse as Talents and can be anything from allergies to phobias to troublesome personality quirks. 

Whenever a Flaw would make it more difficult for a Kid to attempt a Test, they gain **Setback** on the roll. Flaws might also encourage particular actions or events in the story.

### 5. Choose a Desire

A Kid's Desire is something that they want more than almost anything else in the world. It might also be something they don't have (or believe they don't have) at the start of the story. Sometimes Kids will act in selfish or destructive ways to pursue their Desire, but they also learn from these mistakes. 

When a Kid chases their Desire in a way that causes serious problems for their Animon partner or the rest of the group, they immediately gain **1 Bond Strain and 1 XP**.

### 6. Determine Stamina

Stamina represents a Kid's energy levels and their ability to push themselves. All Kid characters start with a Stamina of **4**.

### 7. Determine Starting Bond Points

Bond Points represent the strength of the relationship between a Kid and their Animon partner. All characters start with **3 Bond Points**.

### 8. Record Stuff

Stuff is much less important than a Kid's Special Item, but it can still come in handy sometimes. This is basically a collection of whatever the Kid has in their pockets at any particular moment. Stuff can be lost and replaced as regularly as is appropriate in the story. 

At some point, the Kids will each get an **Ani-Tool**, a special item related to their bond with an Animon. This can also be recorded in the Stuff section when obtained.

### 9. Determine Relationships

Relationships give an idea of how each Kid in the group knows the others. Perhaps they all go to the same school, participate in the same club, or live in the same neighbourhood. Maybe they don't know each other particularly well before the story starts, but at the very least they aren't total strangers.

Whatever brings the whole group together, you should think about the different relationships between each Kid and make notes. Players can discuss this among themselves and invent their own relationships, or they can check the relationships given with each Kid Type.

**Note:** All relationships evolve over time, so these should only be considered a starting point.

## Testing and Dice Mechanics

When a Kid character attempts a task that has a significant chance of failure, they are attempting a 'Test'. For Kid characters, this is usually calculated as:

**Trait + Talent(s) + any relevant bonuses**

- Each die showing **4+** counts as a success under normal circumstances
- With **Boost**: dice results of **3+** count as successes
- With **Setback**: only dice results of **5+** count as successes
- **Double Boost**: results of **2+** count as successes
- **Double Setback**: only results of **6** count as successes

## Character Advancement

Throughout the game, Kid characters can:
- Increase Talent Ranks (maximum Rank 3)
- Gain new Talents
- Increase Bond Level with their Animon partner
- Potentially increase Stamina through story progression

The character's core Traits (Body, Mind, Spirit) remain constant throughout the game, representing the fundamental approach and capabilities of the character.
