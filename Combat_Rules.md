# Combat Rules

This document outlines the comprehensive combat mechanics and rules for Animon Story, based on the core rulebook.

## Overview

Sometimes fights break out — and most Animon are well-equipped for battling one another. In this game, it is very rare for Kids to be directly involved in fighting, as it's difficult for humans to cause Animon any real harm. The Kids will usually try to stay out of danger (although they might not always succeed).

Combat in Animon Story uses a structured turn-based system where characters take actions in Initiative order to defeat their opponents.

## Starting Combat

### Initiative

When a fight is about to start, it's time for Players to roll **Initiative**. The GM also rolls this for any NPCs (Non-Player Characters) involved, including the enemies.

**Initiative Roll:**
- All Animon characters involved in a Combat Encounter roll for Initiative
- This is an **Opposed Test** using the Initiative score (equal to Brains)
- Characters who are surprised (such as victims of an ambush) roll with **Setback**
- Useful Qualities can be used to add dice to the roll

**Turn Order:**
- An Initiative Order is created based on the number of successes rolled
- The most successful character acts first
- In case of ties, the GM can either declare a tie or immediately call for another roll
- Turn order remains the same throughout the combat encounter

### Extended Action Scenes

Sometimes, the GM can declare an **Extended Action Scene**, which is like a longer version of a Combat Encounter that is split into sections, or any intense sequence of events that takes place in a limited time.

Extended Action Scenes follow the same rules as Combat Encounters, except:
- PCs don't regain Signature Attack Uses until the very end
- No healing via 'Catching Your Breath' until the very end

## Combat Actions

### Taking a Turn

On each character's turn, they can perform **one Action** and move around the battlefield as much as is reasonable. If a character chooses not to act, they can Pass and do nothing.

**Available Actions:**
- **Attack:** Make an attack against a target
- **Defend:** Focus entirely on defense (grants Boost on Dodge rolls until next turn)
- **Use Signature Attack:** Perform a special ability
- **Evolve:** Transform to a higher evolutionary stage (Animon only)
- **Other Actions:** Any other reasonable action as determined by the GM

### Movement

Characters can move around the battlefield as much as is reasonable during their turn. The exact distance depends on the scale and nature of the encounter, as determined by the GM.

## Attack Mechanics

### Making an Attack

When a character attacks:

1. **Choose Target:** Select an enemy to attack
2. **Build Dice Pool:** Usually Stat + Quality (+ Signature Attack if applicable)
3. **Make Attack Roll:** Roll the dice pool
4. **Compare to Defense:** Target makes a Dodge roll to defend

### Dice Pool Construction

**For Animon:**
- Base: Relevant Stat (usually Power for attacks)
- Add: Relevant Quality Ranks
- Add: Signature Attack Rank (if using a Signature Attack)
- Add: Any other modifiers (Bond Points, etc.)

### Defense and Dodge

When attacked, the target makes a **Dodge roll**:
- Roll dice equal to Dodge score (equal to Agility)
- Add Ranks of any relevant defensive Qualities
- Compare successes to attacker's successes

**Defense Results:**
- If defender equals or exceeds attacker's successes: Attack misses, no damage
- If attacker has more successes: Attack hits, deal damage

### Damage Resolution

When an attack successfully hits:
- **Base Damage:** Equal to the attacker's Damage score
- **Extra Damage:** +1 damage for each success the attacker rolled beyond the defender's successes
- **Total Damage:** Subtract from target's HP

**Damage by Stage:**
- **FLEDGLING:** Damage = Power
- **BASIC:** Damage = 2 × Power  
- **SUPER:** Damage = 3 × Power
- **ULTRA:** Damage = 4 × Power
- **GIGA:** Damage = 5 × Power

## Setback and Boost in Combat

Several factors can grant **Setback** or **Boost** to Attack or Dodge rolls:

### Element Matchups

**Elemental Advantages:**
- If attacker's Element is **strong** against defender: Attack roll gains **Boost**
- If defender's Element is **strong** against attacker: Attack roll gains **Setback**
- When using Signature Attacks, compare the Attack Element to the defender's Innate Element

### Stage Differences

**Evolution Stage Modifiers:**
- Attacker **one Stage below** defender: Attack has **Setback**
- Attacker **one Stage above** defender: Attack has **Boost**  
- Attackers **two+ Stages apart**: **Double Setback** or **Double Boost** respectively
- Stage differences never modify Dodge rolls

### Defense Action

- Characters who spend their entire Action on defense gain **Boost** on all Defense rolls until their next turn

### Other Modifiers

The GM can decide if other factors grant **Setback** or **Boost** on combat rolls, including environmental conditions, tactical situations, or special circumstances.

## Conditions

Characters can be inflicted with various conditions that affect their combat abilities. Most conditions are negative, except for **Boosted**.

### Positive Conditions

**Boosted:**
- Character gains **Boost** on all their rolls for 1 turn
- Applied by certain Signature Attack effects

### Negative Conditions

**Vulnerable:**
- Character has **Setback** on Dodge rolls
- Applied by Block-Break attacks
- Cannot be applied to the same target more than once per Combat Encounter

**Disoriented:**
- Character has **Setback** on Attack rolls  
- Applied by Misdirect attacks
- Cannot be applied to the same target more than once per Combat Encounter

**Stunned:**
- Character misses their next turn entirely
- Applied by Stunning Strike attacks
- Cannot be applied to the same target more than once per Combat Encounter

**Poisoned:**
- Character takes damage equal to the poisoner's Power at the end of their turn
- Lasts until the Combat Encounter ends
- Applied by Poison Strike attacks
- Can only be applied to one target per Combat Encounter

**Weakened:**
- Character deals half damage with all attacks
- Applied by Sap attacks  
- Cannot be applied to the same target more than once per Combat Encounter

**Incapacitated:**
- Character cannot take actions
- Usually temporary (until end of next turn)
- Can result from certain Signature Attack effects like Overcharge

## Signature Attacks

### Using Signature Attacks

**Limitations:**
- Each Animon can only use their Signature Attack a limited number of times per Combat Encounter
- **Uses = Brains score** of the Animon
- Animon who run out of Uses may spend a **Bond Point** to get an extra use
- All Uses are restored when the Combat Encounter ends

**Multiple Signature Attacks:**
- Evolved Animon can use Signature Attacks from lower Stages
- Using any Signature Attack counts as one Use
- Each Stage gains a new Signature Attack with different starting Ranks:
  - **BASIC Stage:** Rank 1
  - **SUPER Stage:** Rank 2  
  - **ULTRA Stage:** Rank 3
  - **GIGA Stage:** Rank 4

### Signature Attack Effects

Signature Attacks have special effects that modify their behavior:

**Block-Break:** Deal half damage and make target Vulnerable instead of normal damage

**Efficient:** First use each Combat Encounter doesn't count toward total Uses

**Energy Drain:** Regain HP equal to target's Level when dealing damage

**Explosive:** Deal half damage to main target, plus damage equal to your Level to all adjacent enemies

**Heavy Strike:** Deal extra damage equal to 1 + Rank when hitting

**Misdirect:** Disorient target until your next turn in addition to normal damage

**Multi-Element:** Choose which Element the attack uses each time (can be taken multiple times)

**Multi-Hit:** Target multiple enemies by spending additional Uses; single attack roll against highest Dodge

**Poison Strike:** Deal no damage but Poison the target instead

**Overcharge:** Spend multiple Uses to multiply Damage by Uses spent; become Incapacitated if this leaves you with 0 Uses

**Power Transfer:** Give Boosted condition to multiple nearby allies instead of attacking

**Quick Strike:** Gain Boost if target hasn't acted yet this encounter

**Sap:** Deal half damage and Weaken target instead of normal damage

**Stunning Strike:** Deal no damage but Stun target instead

**Tough Break:** Deal half damage and make target Vulnerable; only works if target hasn't been made Vulnerable this encounter

## Knockout and Consequences

### Reaching 0 HP

**When a character is reduced to 0 HP:**
- They are knocked out of the fight (unconscious or totally exhausted)
- **PCs:** Immediately add 1 point to the Critical Gauge and gain a Harm
- **PC Animon of SUPER Stage or higher:** Forced to Devolve (see Devolution rules)
- **NPCs:** Knocked unconscious or destroyed, depending on circumstances

### Devolution from 0 HP

**SUPER Stage or higher reduced to 0 HP:**
- Must immediately Devolve and roll a Heart Test with Difficulty Rating 3
- **Pass:** Devolve to BASIC Stage
- **Fail:** Devolve to FLEDGLING Stage

**BASIC Stage reduced to 0 HP:**
- Roll Heart Test with Difficulty Rating 2
- **Pass:** Remain at BASIC Stage  
- **Fail:** Devolve to FLEDGLING Stage

## Critical Gauge and Critical Moves

### Critical Gauge

The **Critical Gauge** tracks mounting tension and danger in combat:
- Starts at 0 for each Combat Encounter
- Increases when PCs are reduced to 0 HP/Stamina (+1 point)
- Increases when Players roll natural 6s (+1 point per 6)
- Can be tracked with tokens or dice

### Critical Moves

When the Critical Gauge reaches certain thresholds, the GM can trigger **Critical Moves** - dramatic story developments that escalate the situation and increase tension.

## Evolution in Combat

### Evolving During Combat

- **Evolving is immediate** and does not take an Action
- **Cost:** Evolving to current highest Stage costs 1 Bond Point; lower Stages cost nothing
- **HP:** First time reaching a new Stage restores HP to maximum; subsequent evolutions to highest Stage don't reset HP
- **Restrictions:** Can only remain in highest Stage for one Combat Encounter or Scene

### Evolution Requirements

- **SUPER Stage:** Bond Level 3
- **ULTRA Stage:** Bond Level 6
- **GIGA Stage:** Bond Level 9
- Additional requirements may be set by GM (items, story events, etc.)

## End of Combat

### Combat Resolution

A Combat Encounter ends when there is no longer an active and pressing threat to the PCs.

### Catching Your Breath

At the end of combat, **all Animon characters** (including those reduced to 0 HP) can catch their breath:
- **Regain HP:** 1 + Heart score
- **Restore Signature Attack Uses:** All Uses are restored
- **Kids:** Cannot restore Stamina this way - requires proper Rest

### Post-Combat Consequences

- Characters who were reduced to 0 HP/Stamina have gained **Harm**
- Critical Gauge resets to 0
- Any temporary conditions end
- Evolved Animon must Devolve if they've been in their highest Stage for the duration

## Special Combat Rules

### Kids in Combat

- Kids rarely participate directly in combat
- When they do, they use **Stamina** instead of HP
- Kids reduced to 0 Stamina suffer the same consequences as Animon at 0 HP
- Kids cannot "catch their breath" - they need proper Rest to recover Stamina

### Bond Points in Combat

**Combat Uses for Bond Points:**
- **Extra Dice:** Add 1 die to any roll for 1 Bond Point
- **Extra Signature Attack Use:** Gain one additional use when out of Uses
- **Fight On:** Spend 3 Bond Points when reduced to 0 HP/Stamina to instead drop to 1 HP/Stamina
- **Story Changes:** Spend 1-3 Bond Points to add advantageous story elements

### Environmental Factors

The GM can apply **Setback** or **Boost** based on:
- **Terrain:** Difficult ground, elevation advantages, obstacles
- **Weather:** Rain, darkness, extreme temperatures  
- **Positioning:** Flanking, cover, range
- **Equipment:** Special items, tools, or weapons
- **Circumstances:** Surprise, preparation time, ally assistance

## Tactical Considerations

### Team Coordination

- Multiple characters can coordinate attacks
- Supporting actions can grant allies advantages
- Positioning and movement matter for area effects
- Evolution timing can be strategically important

### Resource Management

- **Signature Attack Uses:** Limited per encounter, plan usage carefully
- **Bond Points:** Shared resource between Kid and Animon
- **HP/Stamina:** Manage health carefully, consider when to retreat
- **Evolution:** Higher stages are powerful but temporary

### Combat Strategy

- **Element matchups** can significantly affect combat effectiveness
- **Stage differences** create power imbalances
- **Condition effects** can turn the tide of battle
- **Signature Attack timing** and effect selection is crucial
- **Defense vs. Offense:** Sometimes focusing on defense is the better choice
